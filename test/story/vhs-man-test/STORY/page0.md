# Page 0: Last Rental

Rain hit the windshield in sheets. The wipers fought it—slap, drag, slap, drag—each cycle buying a half second of clarity before the water closed back in. Ash drove with one hand on the wheel and the other wrapped around a coffee cup from the gas station, the cardboard sleeve already soft with condensation, the lid leaking at the seam where he'd pried it open to blow on the surface. The coffee was terrible. The coffee was always terrible. He drank it anyway, the same way he'd been drinking terrible gas station coffee for twenty years, the same way he'd been driving this truck for fifteen, the same way he'd been pulling into this parking lot for three.

Video Haven Rentals. The sign glowed through the rain, its letters a faded blue that had once been vivid enough to see from the highway. Now you had to be in the parking lot to read it, and even then the "R" in Rentals flickered with an electrical short that nobody had fixed because fixing things cost money and money had stopped flowing through this particular business about the same time Netflix started mailing DVDs.

Ash parked in his usual spot—third from the entrance, next to the dumpster, far enough from the streetlight that the truck's rust spots didn't show. He killed the engine. Sat for a moment in the quiet between the rain and the building, finishing the last of the coffee, watching the store's front windows for signs of life. The lights were on. Harold was inside.

He grabbed his jacket from the passenger seat. Worn denim, the cuffs frayed to threads, a tear in the left shoulder he'd safety-pinned shut six months ago and never properly mended. The rain hit him the instant he stepped out—cold, October rain, the kind that found every gap in your clothes and settled against your skin like it planned to stay. He jogged to the entrance. The bell above the door jingled as he pushed through.

Inside smelled like it always smelled: popcorn from the warmer that hadn't held popcorn in two years, carpet shampoo from the last deep clean (April), and the underlying constant—plastic and magnetic strip and chemical binder. The smell of ten thousand VHS tapes decaying in slow unison, their contents degrading frame by frame, the magnetic particles shedding from their substrate like dead skin cells. Ash had read somewhere that every VHS tape lost quality with each viewing, that the act of playing them was the act of destroying them, that the movies they held were dying the same death their format had already died. He'd thought about that more than he should have.

"You look like a drowned cat." Harold stood behind the counter, reading glasses perched on the end of his nose, a pen tucked behind his ear. He was doing the books. The books were thin enough to read in an evening now—two columns of numbers that added up to less than the power bill.

"Feel like one." Ash hung his jacket on the hook behind the register. Water dripped from the hem onto the mat. "Busy night?"

Harold's face did something complicated. The expression of a man trying to find the right words for a thing he didn't want to say, his mouth opening and closing twice before committing. "Got a call from corporate."

"We don't have a corporate."

"The owner. The holding company. Whatever they are." Harold set the pen down. Took off his glasses. Rubbed his eyes. "Store's done, Ash. Papers signed this afternoon. Demolition crew starts Monday."

The words landed the way bad news always lands—quietly, with a slight delay between hearing and understanding, like sound arriving before the shockwave. Ash stood by the register. The mat under his boots squelched.

"Monday."

"Monday."

"As in five days from Monday."

"As in five days." Harold put his glasses back on. Picked up the pen. Put it down again. "I tried to push it. Told them we had inventory to clear, outstanding rentals, the whole song. They don't care. Building's worth more as dirt than it is as a store."

Ash looked at the aisles. The shelves stretched back in rows—COMEDY, DRAMA, ACTION, HORROR, SCI-FI, FAMILY—hand-painted signs that Harold's wife had made when they'd converted from Blockbuster to independent. The shelves were half-empty. Most of the stock was in the storeroom, boxed up from previous downsizing rounds, the inventory contracting like a dying star. What remained on the floor was the core collection—the tapes people still occasionally asked for, the cult classics and the horror staples and the handful of new-release DVDs that sat in their cases gathering dust.

"So this is—"

"Last week." Harold's voice was even. Controlled. The voice of a man who'd had all afternoon to process and had arrived at a place somewhere between resignation and relief. "I need someone to work the close-out. Final inventory. Clear the storeroom. Lock up on the last night." He looked at Ash. "You want it?"

"The last shift at the last video store?"

"That's the pitch."

Ash looked at the shelves again. The fluorescent lights hummed above them—a sound so constant, so embedded in his daily existence, that he only noticed it in moments of silence. The rain drummed on the roof. A car passed on the street outside, its headlights sweeping the window and moving on.

"Sure." He grabbed the mop from the supply closet. "Hail to the king."

Harold almost smiled. "Pay's bumped for the trouble. And whatever's left on the shelves when we lock up—take what you want. Consider it severance."

The evening passed the way evenings at Video Haven always passed—slowly, quietly, punctuated by the occasional jingle of the door bell and the soft click-clack of VHS cases being placed on the counter. Three customers. Mrs. Okonkwo returned a Meg Ryan double feature two weeks overdue and paid the late fee in exact change from a coin purse. A college kid rented something from the horror section, his phone out the entire time, filming the store for what he called "an aesthetic TikTok." A man Ash didn't recognize browsed the action aisle for twenty minutes, picked up a copy of *Die Hard*, put it back, picked it up again, and left without renting anything.

By nine, the store was empty. Harold packed his briefcase—an actual briefcase, leather, a relic from whatever life he'd lived before video retail. He paused at the door.

"Ash."

"Yeah."

"The storeroom. Owner wants it cleared by Wednesday. There's stuff in the back that's been there since before I took over. Crates, old stock, the attic overflow. I don't even know what's in half of it." He hesitated. "There's a door in the back corner. Behind the horror overflow boxes."

Ash looked up from the mop.

"I've never gotten it open. Previous manager said it was a maintenance access, sealed off when they renovated in '94. Leave it alone if it stays locked." Harold's eyes held something Ash couldn't quite read—not fear, exactly. Something adjacent to fear. Caution wearing a reasonable face. "If it opens, call me."

"If a door opens, I should call you."

"Just—" Harold put on his hat. Adjusted the brim. "Call me."

The bell jingled. The door swung shut. Harold's car started in the lot, headlights sweeping, taillights receding. Gone.

Ash stood in the empty store. The fluorescents hummed. The rain fell. The VHS tapes sat on their shelves in their plastic cases, thousands of hours of recorded light and sound slowly dying in the dark.

He mopped. The floor gleamed wet behind each stroke, reflecting the overhead lights in long, warped lines. He worked from the front to the back, aisle by aisle, the way he'd done it every shift for three years, the ritual of it calming something in his chest that had been tight since Harold said the word "Monday."

The storeroom door was open. He'd need to start on the crates tomorrow. Tonight was about the floors, the counters, the register drawer. The normal things. The closing ritual of a building that had five days left to be a building.

He wrung the mop. Water splashed into the bucket. His reflection warped in the gray surface—a face that looked older than forty-three, stubbled and tired, the eyes narrowed from years of fluorescent squint. He straightened up. His back popped. His knees negotiated their usual terms.

Somewhere in the storeroom, behind the crates he hadn't moved, behind the door Harold had told him to leave alone, something shifted. A sound too faint to identify. Metal against metal. A lock. A latch. A mechanism engaging or disengaging, the difference impossible to tell from this distance.

Ash stopped mopping. Listened. The store was quiet. The rain was quiet. The hum of the lights filled the silence the way water fills a glass—completely, invisibly, until you noticed it was there.

Nothing else. No other sound.

He finished mopping. He locked up. He drove home through the rain, the wipers beating time, the radio playing classic rock through a haze of static, and every door he passed—every shop entrance, every apartment lobby, every gas station bathroom—was just a door.

Just a door.
