# World: The Quad

The Quad is a Gothic-style former insane asylum built in 1914, completely landlocked 
with no street access. Surrounded by modern development, it exists as a pocket of 
horror frozen in time. Contains hellmouth portal in deepest cellar that manifests 
visitors' fears as physical grotesques.
