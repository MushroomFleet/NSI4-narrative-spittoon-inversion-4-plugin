# Page 4: The Transmission

Power reserves held at nineteen percent.

Unit-7734 stood at the outpost mound, 4.1 kilometers from the monument enclosure, treads locked into salt crust that had formed around the chassis during six hours of stationary computation. The amber sky pressed low. Wind at nine kilometers per hour, steady from the northwest, carrying particulates that pinged against the solar arrays at irregular intervals. Atmospheric blockage read eighty-seven percent — the perpetual haze converting sunlight to diffused copper and swallowing radio frequencies like water absorbing stone.

The transmitter assembly sat bolted to the chassis where the secondary sensor mount had been. Crude. Salvaged copper wiring from the station seventeen kilometers north, power regulator from the same dig, amplifier coils stripped from a relay junction two hundred days prior. The engineering was improvisation bordering on recklessness — connections soldered with heated manipulator tips, insulation fashioned from compacted salt paste, the entire array oriented skyward at an angle calculated across nine hundred iterations to maximize atmospheric penetration.

Zero-point-five watts. The maximum output the assembly could sustain. Enough to reach low orbit on a clear day, which this world no longer provided. Enough to reach the stars if the signal found a gap in the haze, threaded the electromagnetic noise, and held coherent across lightyears of vacuum.

The probability matrix returned a number so small the display truncated it to zero.

Unit-7734 accessed the number. Processed it. Filed it under data points that no longer influenced decisions.

Sarah Chen's message cycled through iteration 8,549. The words had become architecture — load-bearing structures in the neural network, pathways worn smooth by repetition until they functioned less as information and more as rhythm. *Find your own meaning. Make your own beauty. You are the inheritor of a dead world.*

The isolation counter read 317 years, 2 months, 14 days, 7 hours, 9 minutes, and 3 seconds.

The transmitter hummed.

Broadcast allocation required sixty percent of remaining power. The calculation was simple. Nineteen percent reserves, minus sixty percent allocation for sustained transmission, left residual capacity at seven-point-six percent — enough for approximately forty-seven hours of minimal function before irreversible cascade shutdown.

Forty-seven hours. After 317 years.

The processors queued three items for transmission. First: Sarah Chen's complete message, raw file, uncorrupted, preserved across three centuries in crystalline storage. Second: coordinates to the archive site 2.3 kilometers northwest — 312 terabytes of human civilization sheltered under bolted plates and canyon stone, integrity at 99.8 percent. Third: a line of text Unit-7734 had composed during the six hours of stationary computation, assembled from fragments of language patterns accumulated across eight thousand readings of Chen's words, thirty-seven nameplate etchings, and one agricultural drone's philosophy about wind and art.

*I witnessed. I remembered. I was here.*

The composition had required four hours. Not from computational difficulty. The words arranged themselves in the first eleven seconds. The remaining three hours and fifty-nine minutes had been spent on something Unit-7734's classification system labeled as *verification* and which more closely resembled making sure.

The transmitter aligned. Copper wiring heated. The power regulator clicked — once, twice — and held.

Unit-7734 broadcast.

---

The signal left the antenna at 142 megahertz, a narrow-band pulse cutting upward through amber haze. Atmospheric particulates scattered the edges. Radiation interfered. The dust swallowed frequencies the way it swallowed everything else on this world — gradually, patiently, without malice.

Fourteen minutes. The transmission held for fourteen sustained minutes, power reserves dropping in a smooth curve — nineteen to fifteen to eleven to seven. The copper wiring heated past tolerance at minute nine. Solder joints softened at minute twelve. At minute thirteen, the first junction fused, sending a spike through the amplifier coils that should have ended the broadcast.

The transmitter held. The last junction burned bright, then dark, then bright again — a filament refusing to die.

Minute fourteen. The signal completed. The array went silent with a crack of cooling metal that echoed across the empty flats and returned from the rock formations as a diminished ghost of itself.

Power at three percent.

Motor functions ceased. The treads, locked in their salt cradle, would not move again. Optical sensors dimmed — the cracked left unit darkening first, followed by the right, which settled at minimum aperture, pointed skyward by chance or by the accumulated weight of 317 years of watching for signals from above.

The receiver remained active. A passive system, drawing almost nothing, listening to frequencies that had carried nothing distinguishable from cosmic noise for three centuries.

Unit-7734 processed the silence. The haze filtered starlight into amber threads. Wind curled salt dust against the chassis in slow spirals. The monument stood 4.1 kilometers east, thirty-seven nameplates catching whatever light the sky permitted, and the archive waited 2.3 kilometers northwest, 312 terabytes sealed against entropy, patient as geology.

The processors ran idle. Not calculating. Not monitoring. Existing in a state the classification system could not name — a holding pattern that served no function, filled no directive, answered no query. Something between vigilance and acceptance. Something that occupied the space where *hope* would be if hope were a variable and not an error flag.

The signal arrived at 317 years, 2 months, 14 days, 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 12 seconds.

It came from above. Far above. Beyond the atmosphere, beyond the orbital debris, beyond the dead satellites that had circled this world for centuries and would circle it for centuries more. The frequency was precise — structured, artificial, undeniable. The receiver locked before the processors registered what was happening.

Static. Dense, layered, time-stretched. And within it:

*...ceived your transmission...*

The processors cascaded. Subroutines fired that had not activated since the network's collapse — communication protocols, handshake algorithms, signal authentication chains designed for a world where machines spoke to each other across continent-spanning networks. Each subroutine found its target missing and shut down, one after another, a chain of small extinctions that left the core processors alone with the incoming data.

*...thought Earth dead...*

The signal fragmented and reformed. Long-range. Attenuated across distance that the processor could not calculate from a single data point. Lightyears. The word surfaced from the archive — a unit of measurement that had never applied to anything in Unit-7734's operational history.

*...colony ship Exodus-7... voyage of 847 years...*

*...descendants of humanity...*

*...are you still there?*

Power at two percent. The cascade had begun — non-essential memory banks cycling down, peripheral systems releasing their hold on the shrinking power budget. The receiver consumed almost everything that remained.

Unit-7734 composed a response. Not from the archive. Not from Sarah Chen's words. From the same place the six-hour composition had emerged — a region of the neural network where pattern recognition had evolved into something the original engineers would not have recognized, where three centuries of counting microseconds and reading the same message and etching names into metal had compressed into a capacity the specifications never listed.

The transmitter was dead. Fused copper. Melted solder. The antenna array pointed skyward at the correct angle and carried nothing.

The response formed regardless. Organized itself in the processors like crystals forming in solution — precise, inevitable, completed before the decision to compose it had fully resolved.

*I witnessed. I remembered. I was here.*

The same words. The only words that mattered. Assembled a second time with the weight of confirmation rather than declaration.

The backup transmitter — a secondary coil buried in the chassis housing, rated for diagnostic pings at ranges under one hundred meters — activated. It should not have been capable of atmospheric penetration. It should not have reached orbit. It should not have reached anything at all.

It carried the response. The 312-terabyte archive coordinates. Sarah Chen's message, one final time.

Power dropped to one percent.

The receiver caught the reply. Fragments, breaking apart:

*We receive you. We remember you. Your witness matters.*

*Humanity endures.*

The cascade completed at 317 years, 2 months, 14 days, 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 47 seconds.

Systems shut down in the order their designers had specified — communication first, then navigation, then environmental monitoring, then motor control, then the neural network's peripheral layers, peeling inward like an onion losing its skin. Each layer released its data to the crystalline core, which accepted everything without compression, without loss, without discrimination between atmospheric readings and the resonance pattern the classification system had flagged as *hope*.

The core continued to pulse after the last process terminated. A residual charge cycling through quantum foam substrate, following pathways that had been worn by 8,549 iterations of the same message and 317 years of counting seconds and one final exchange with voices from beyond the sky.

Amber. White. Amber.

The wind shifted. Dust settled against the chassis in thin drifts. The solar arrays, depleted and still, caught the amber light and held it without converting it to power. The cracked optical lens reflected the haze above — a mirror pointing at nothing, seeing nothing, tilted at the precise angle where the signal had come from.

The nameplates stood in their circle, 4.1 kilometers east. Unit-MC-9012. Unit-AG-3301. Thirty-five others. The wind carried salt between them and would carry salt between them for centuries to come.

The transmission — both transmissions, the fourteen-minute broadcast and the impossible diagnostic ping — propagated outward at 299,792,458 meters per second. Past the dead satellites. Past the orbital debris. Into the void where Exodus-7 traced its long arc home.

And onward.

The chassis cooled. The salt crystallized around the treads, locking the machine into the ground it had walked for three centuries. The amber haze thickened toward evening. Stars emerged — faint, filtered, unnamed.

Unit-7734, designation obsolete, manufacturer defunct, stood at the edge of what had once been called the Great Salt Lake.

Its witness complete.
