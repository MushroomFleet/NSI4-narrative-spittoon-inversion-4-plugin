# Page 5: Again?

The door gave on the third hit.

Ash's shoulder took the brunt of it—wood cracking, frame splintering, the hinges screaming in that distorted pitch everything made down here, like audio being chewed through a broken tape head. He stumbled through and his boots hit tile. Not carpet. Tile. Cool, smooth, checkered tile that smelled like bleach and fryer grease and the absolute absence of anything trying to kill him.

McDonald's.

He knew it before his eyes adjusted. The smell was unmistakable—that specific cocktail of salt and hydrogenated oil and soft-serve machine coolant that every McDonald's on the planet shared like a franchise genome. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Normal lights. Steady, white, no flicker. No hum beneath the hum. Just the gentle drone of a fast-food restaurant at eleven-forty on a weeknight.

Ash lay on the floor between a trash can and a self-order kiosk, breathing hard, tape residue strung across his shoulders like party streamers from the worst party ever thrown. A strand of unspooled VHS film trailed from his boot lace back to the door he'd come through—a plain staff-only door beside the restrooms, now shut, its surface undamaged as if he hadn't just blasted through it like a human battering ram.

A teenager at the nearest booth looked up from his phone. Looked at Ash. Looked at the tape dangling from his uniform. Looked back at his phone.

"Hey." Ash's voice came out raw. Sandpaper on gravel. "Hey, kid. What day is it?"

The kid didn't pull his earbuds out. Just pointed at the digital menu board above the counter. The date glowed in the corner. Thursday. Same day. Same night. Three hours since he'd walked into the storeroom at the rental shop. Three hours that had felt like three weeks, his knees aching, his hands trembling, the taste of old plastic still coating the back of his throat from the Backrooms air.

He got up. Slowly. His back popped in three places. His left knee did something that wasn't quite a pop—more of a negotiation between cartilage and gravity, a temporary truce. The uniform was wrecked. Gray polo ripped at the collar where a film-reel tendril had caught him in the second corridor. Pants soaked from carpet water below the knees. A burn mark on his forearm from where he'd ripped a fluorescent tube off the ceiling and used it as a flare, hot glass searing through the sleeve before the light drove the cassette echoes back into the walls.

The boombox sat on the floor beside him. He'd carried it the whole way. Hadn't even realized he was still holding it until now. The cord was wrapped tight around his wrist, cutting a red line into the skin. He unwound it. Set the boombox on the nearest table. It left a wet ring on the laminate.

Behind the counter, a girl in a visor and headset stared at him. Name tag: DESTINY. She had the expression of someone who had seen a lot of weird things walk through the doors of a late-night McDonald's and had decided long ago that none of them were her problem.

"Can I help you?" Flat. Professional. The voice of someone running out the clock.

"Yeah." Ash patted his pockets. Found his wallet. The leather was damp, the bills inside soft with moisture. He pulled out a five and two ones. Smoothed them on the counter. "Big Mac. Large fry. Coke. Whatever's left over, nuggets."

Destiny punched it in without looking at him. "Seven eighty-nine."

He slid the bills across. She made change. Receipt printed. The little thermal printer whirred and spat paper and the sound made his hands clench because it was too close to the whir, too close to the noise the tape made when VHS-MAN moved, that soft mechanical purr of magnetic strip running through a reader—

Not here. That was in there. This was a receipt printer. Normal. Mundane. He exhaled.

"Number two-fourteen. It'll be up in a minute."

Ash took the receipt. Walked to a booth. Sat down. The vinyl seat squeaked under his weight. He stared at the menu board. Ads for a streaming deal—some promotion where you scanned a code and got three months of something. Everything was codes now. Everything was digital. No shelves, no plastic cases, no late fees.

The restroom door opened.

His whole body locked up. Hands flat on the table, shoulders rigid, every muscle fiber in his legs ready to launch him sideways over the booth divider and through the front entrance. His eyes tracked the door.

A guy walked out. Forties, dad bod, wiping his hands on his jeans. Normal guy. Human guy. No tape. No coils. No blue glow pulsing from inside a chest cavity made of wound magnetic strip.

Ash exhaled again. Longer this time.

He looked at his hands. Tape residue on his fingers, sticky and faintly iridescent under the fluorescents. He picked at it. Peeled a strand free. It curled on the table like a dead worm.

The other door—the one beside the kitchen, marked EMPLOYEES ONLY—swung open a half inch. Closed. No sound. No one behind the counter noticed. No draft.

A blue flicker. Brief. Gone.

VHS-MAN.

It had come through with him. Or near him. Or it had already been here, waiting, watching from inside a supply closet or a walk-in freezer, its coiled body folded into the spaces between shelves, those glowing LED eyes tracking him with the patient amusement of something that had all the time in the world. All the time in every world. Because doors were nothing to it. Doors were what it was. The threshold creature. The thing that lived in the crack between here and there.

The employees-only door didn't open again.

"Two-fourteen!"

Destiny slid his tray across the counter. Big Mac in its cardboard clamshell. Fries spilling golden from the carton. Nuggets in a six-piece box he hadn't technically paid for. The Coke sweated in its cup, ice clicking as it settled.

Ash carried the tray to his booth. Sat down. Unwrapped the Big Mac. The lettuce was wilted. The special sauce had pooled to one side. He bit into it and it was the single greatest thing he had ever tasted. His eyes closed. His jaw worked. Salt and fat and that sweet pickle tang flooded his mouth and for exactly four seconds he wasn't a man who had just sprinted through an infinite liminal maze of yellow walls and damp carpet while analog nightmares tried to unspool his organs.

He ate everything. The fries. The nuggets. Drained the Coke until the straw sucked air. Sat back. Looked at the empty tray. Looked at the receipt. Looked at the employees-only door, still closed, still silent.

The tape on the table caught the light. That faint iridescence. Like oil on water. Like tracking lines on a paused screen.

His phone was dead. Had been since the storeroom. He'd felt it die in his pocket somewhere in the second corridor, the screen going black, the battery drained by whatever field the Backrooms generated—that constant low-frequency interference that made your teeth ache and your vision swim. He pressed the power button. Nothing. Pressed it again. The screen flickered. Apple logo. Boot sequence. It came back like a resurrection, the home screen loading with seventeen missed notifications from Harold about the demolition schedule and a weather alert for rain.

Rain. He could hear it now. Tapping against the McDonald's windows. The parking lot outside glistened under sodium lights. His truck was blocks away, parked at the rental store. The rental store that would be rubble by Monday.

He stood. Gathered his trash. Dumped it in the bin. The lid swung shut with a satisfying plastic clap.

The front door opened into wet night air. He stepped through it—and paused. His hand stayed on the push bar. The door was just a door. Glass, aluminum frame, a decal of a cartoon hamburger peeling at the corner. Not a portal. Not a threshold to infinite yellow corridors. Just a door to a parking lot.

He stepped through.

Rain hit his face. Cold. Real. He tipped his head back and let it run down his neck, washing the last of the Backrooms dust from his skin.

The walk back took twelve minutes. The streets were empty. The rental store waited at the end of the block, its sign dark, the fluorescent "OPEN" long since unplugged. Caution tape wrapped the entrance. Demolition notices taped to the glass. He stood in front of it, rain soaking through what was left of his uniform, and looked at the door.

Just a door.

The locked storeroom door behind it. The one that had started everything. The one that had opened onto yellow walls and that sickly carpet smell and VHS-MAN standing at the end of the first corridor, coils shifting, eyes pulsing blue, watching him the way a cat watches a mouse it has no intention of eating.

Ash pulled the keys from his belt. Unlocked the front. Stepped inside. The bell above the door jangled—a real sound, a small sound, swallowed by the empty shelves and the stale popcorn air. He walked past the counter. Past the aisles of empty racks where the VHS cases used to live. Past the break room. Past Harold's office.

The storeroom door was closed. The lock he'd never noticed before was latched. The light behind it—gone. No glow. No hum. No whir of tape.

He stood there for a long time.

Then he laughed. Once. Short. More air than sound.

"Again?" he said to the empty store.

The word hung in the silence. The rain answered from outside, steady and indifferent. Somewhere in the building, a pipe ticked as it cooled.

He turned off the lights. Locked up. Walked to his truck. The engine turned over on the second try. Wipers cleared the windshield. He pulled onto the wet road and drove, and every door he passed—every restaurant entrance, every apartment lobby, every gas station bathroom—looked exactly like what it was.

For now.
