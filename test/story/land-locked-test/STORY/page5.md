# Land Locked - Page 5 (Ending)

The concrete scraped Matt's back as Jane lowered him against the wall. Cold. Everything cold. The night air bit at his skin, but he couldn't feel his left leg anymore. Couldn't feel much of anything below the knee.

"Stay with me." Jane's hands pressed against his thigh. Warm. Wet. "Matt, look at me. Look at me."

He tried. The square of sky above them—that impossible square framed by apartment buildings—kept tilting. Darkness and streetlights trading places. The Quad loomed behind them, its Gothic silhouette cutting into the Halloween night. They'd climbed the wall. Somehow. Ten feet of vertical concrete with a dog-thing snapping at their heels, and they'd climbed it.

He'd climbed it. With one good leg.

Jane's face swam into focus. Dirt streaked across her cheek. Blood—not hers—splattered on her shirt. Her eyes weren't confident anymore. They were wide. Panicked. Her hands shook as she pressed harder.

"Everything's going to be okay," she said. Her voice cracked on the last word. "Someone's going to see us. We're out. We're outside."

Matt coughed. Tasted copper. "Jane—"

"Don't talk. Save your strength. Just... just stay with me."

She'd dragged him. Through shifting corridors that shouldn't exist, past walls that appeared where doors had been, around collapsed sections that rebuilt themselves when you looked away. She'd dragged him when he wanted to stop. When he'd told her to leave him.

The torch lay beside them, its flames guttering in the breeze. They'd built it from broken furniture and someone's abandoned jacket soaked in something flammable from a janitor's closet. The flame-light had kept the dog-thing at bay. Barely. Matt could still see it in his mind—shin-height, all muscle and teeth, dark fur stretched over impossible anatomy. A bulldog's body with a shark's mouth. Too many teeth. Way too many.

His fear. Made real.

Steve's face flashed behind his eyes. Steve laughing at his jokes. Steve dismissing the danger. Steve's expression when the cat-thing—Jane's fear—had materialized from nothing and—

Matt squeezed his eyes shut. Didn't help. Still saw it. The tearing. The pulling. The way Steve had imploded into that pinhole of nothing, still screaming, still writhing.

"I can't feel my leg," he whispered.

"You're going to be fine." Jane's jaw clenched. She looked around, desperate. The street beyond the wall's edge was empty. Halloween decorations hung from porches. Fake cobwebs. Plastic skeletons. The irony would be funny if he wasn't dying. "Someone has to come. Someone—"

Footsteps.

Jane's head snapped up. "Help! Please, we need help!"

A man appeared around the corner. Middle-aged. Casual clothes. He stopped, taking in the scene with unsettling calm. Matt bleeding out. Jane covered in gore. The guttering torch. The Gothic nightmare of The Quad behind them, its windows dark except for that wrong light deep in the cellar.

"Please," Jane begged. "He's hurt. Call 911. Please."

The man pulled out his phone. Slow. Methodical. His face showed no urgency. No shock. He dialed, brought it to his ear, waited.

"Yes, I need an ambulance," he said. Flat tone. Professional. "The Quad area, behind the apartment complex. Two teenagers. One is injured."

Matt watched him. Something wrong. Something about the way he stood. The way he looked at them. Not like someone who'd stumbled onto an emergency. Like someone who'd been expecting it.

"Help is coming," the man said to Jane. Still that flat tone. "Stay calm."

But Jane was staring at him now too. Matt saw recognition dawn in her eyes. Not of the man himself, but of what he represented. The too-calm demeanor. The lack of questions. The way he positioned himself between them and the street, like a barrier rather than a helper.

From The Quad, a sound. Low. Harmonic. The building's breathing, that slow cycle that made your jaw ache and your hearing feel wrong. And underneath it, something else. Something moving in the darkness. The third grotesque. Jane's fear, spawning slow. Slow because she was terrified now. Not the confident skeptic anymore. Just terrified.

Matt's vision blurred. Jane's hands on his leg felt distant. The man's voice on the phone—"Yes, I'll wait here"—sounded like it came from underwater. The square sky above tilted again, and this time it didn't straighten.

"Matt!" Jane's voice, sharp with panic. "No, no, no. Stay with me. Please stay with me."

He tried to answer. Couldn't remember how. His mouth wouldn't work right. The cold spread from his leg up through his chest. Heavy. Everything heavy.

"The ambulance is coming," the man said. Still standing there. Still blocking the street. "They'll be here soon."

Would they? Would they be in time? Matt couldn't tell anymore. Couldn't tell if the man meant to help or ensure something else. Couldn't tell if the wet warmth pooling beneath him was from the wound or from the October rain that wasn't falling. Couldn't tell if Jane's tears were real or just reflections from the torch-light.

Couldn't tell—

"Matt, please. Everything's going to be okay." Jane's voice broke completely. "Someone's calling for help. You're going to be okay. You're going to—"

The Gothic facade of The Quad watched them. Patient. Silent. Waiting.

The man with the phone waited too.

And in the deepest cellar, behind that spotless door, the hellmouth pulsed with that impossible color no human eye should perceive, hungry and patient and fed by fear, fed by pain, fed by the desperation of a girl trying to save her friend while the square sky framed them all like a photograph.

Like a memory.

Like an ending that wasn't quite finished.

The torch flames flickered.

Matt's breathing grew shallow.

And somewhere in the darkness, something with bone-like talons and a Cheshire smile began, slowly, to take shape.
