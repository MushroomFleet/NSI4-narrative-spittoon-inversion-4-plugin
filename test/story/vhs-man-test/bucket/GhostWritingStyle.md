# Ghost Writing Style Guide

## Core Philosophy

Write with the rhythm and texture of literary fiction while maintaining narrative momentum. Balance beauty with brutality, eloquence with efficiency.

## Sentence Structure

### Vary Sentence Length
- **Short**: Impact. Urgency. Power.
- **Medium**: Standard narrative flow with natural rhythm.
- **Long**: Complex thoughts, detailed descriptions, or building tension through accumulation of details that create an overwhelming sense of atmosphere.

### Mix Structures
- Simple: "The ship lurched."
- Compound: "The lights flickered, and the engine noise changed pitch."
- Complex: "As the temperature dropped, frost began spreading across the viewport."
- Fragment: "No warning. No time."

## Dialogue Rules

### Natural Speech Patterns
Real people:
- Interrupt each other
- Leave sentences unfinished
- Use contractions
- Speak in fragments
- Pause, hesitate, stumble

**Example:**
"Look, I—" She glanced at the door. "I don't think we should—"

"Should what?" He stepped closer. "Finish it."

### Distinct Voices
Each character must have:
- Unique vocabulary level
- Consistent speech patterns
- Cultural/professional influences
- Emotional tells in their speech

### Dialogue Tags
- Use "said" most of the time (invisible to readers)
- Replace tags with action when possible:
  - ❌ "I don't believe you," she said angrily.
  - ✅ "I don't believe you." She turned away.

## Pacing Techniques

### Speed Up (Action/Tension)
- Short sentences
- Simple words
- Active voice
- Fragment sentences
- Rapid-fire dialogue
- Minimal description

### Slow Down (Reflection/Description)
- Longer, flowing sentences
- Sensory details
- Internal thoughts
- Descriptive language
- Extended metaphors

## Show Don't Tell

### Emotion Through Action
- ❌ She was nervous.
- ✅ Her fingers drummed against the armrest. Tap, tap, tap.

### State Through Dialogue
- ❌ He was suspicious.
- ✅ "Convenient timing." His eyes never left her hands.

### Atmosphere Through Detail
- ❌ The place was dangerous.
- ✅ Rust ate through the railings. The air tasted of metal and decay.

## Descriptive Guidelines

### The Five Senses
Don't rely solely on sight:
- **Sound**: "The ventilation system wheezed like emphysemic lungs."
- **Touch**: "The metal bit into his palm, cold and unforgiving."
- **Smell**: "Ozone and burnt plastic—the scent of failing electronics."
- **Taste**: "Copper flooded his mouth as he bit his lip."

### Specific Over Generic
- ❌ The weapon was on the table.
- ✅ The pulse pistol lay beside her coffee cup, its charge indicator blinking amber.

### Active Voice
Prefer active constructions:
- ❌ The door was opened by her.
- ✅ She opened the door.

Exception: Use passive when the actor is unknown or unimportant.

## Opening Hooks

Start with:
1. **Immediate Action**: "The explosion threw Thomas against the bulkhead."
2. **Intriguing Statement**: "The star charts said they were five light-years from Earth."
3. **Sensory Immersion**: "The air inside the pod tasted like recycled fear."
4. **Character in Motion**: "She ran, and kept running, because stopping meant thinking."

Never start with:
- Weather (unless crucial)
- Alarm clocks
- Backstory dumps
- Abstract philosophy

## Paragraph Structure

### Purpose of Paragraphs
- **Single idea** per paragraph
- **White space** creates pacing
- **Short paragraphs** = fast pacing
- **Long paragraphs** = immersive detail

### Paragraph Breaks
Break paragraphs when:
- Speaker changes
- Scene shifts
- Time passes
- Focus changes
- You want emphasis

## Word Choice

### Strong Verbs
Replace weak verb + adverb with strong verb:
- ❌ walked quickly → sprinted
- ❌ looked angrily → glared
- ❌ held tightly → clutched

### Concrete Nouns
Be specific:
- ❌ container → cargo pod
- ❌ device → scanner
- ❌ place → maintenance bay

### Cut Unnecessary Words
- ❌ "started to run" → "ran"
- ❌ "began to realize" → "realized"
- ❌ "in order to" → "to"

## Metaphor and Simile

Use sparingly and make them:
1. **Fresh**: Avoid clichés (cold as ice, dark as night)
2. **Consistent**: Match your universe and characters
3. **Purposeful**: Add meaning, not just decoration

**Good**: "His mind was a broken compass, spinning without north."
**Bad**: "Her eyes were like stars" (cliché, meaningless)
