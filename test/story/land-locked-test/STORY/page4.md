# Page 4: Over the Wall

The window wouldn't break.

Jane swung the chair leg again, cracking it against the glass. The pane shuddered, spiderwebbed, held. Behind her, Matt slumped against the corridor wall, his left leg twisted at an angle that made her stomach lurch every time she looked at it. The dog-thing had caught him on the stairs. One lunge, jaws closing around his calf, teeth punching through denim and skin and muscle before she'd kicked it free.

"Again," Matt said through clenched teeth. Sweat ran down his face. His skin had gone grey. "Hit it again."

She did. The glass exploded outward, shards catching the moonlight as they fell into the narrow gap between The Quad and the apartment building next door. October air rushed in, cold and clean and smelling of rain and freedom. Jane gulped it. After hours in the asylum's stale corridors, breathing dust and rot and that sweet copper stink from the cellar, the outside air tasted like salvation.

"Okay." She dropped the chair leg. Her palms were blistered and bleeding. "Okay, we need to climb."

Matt stared at the window. Ten feet off the ground. Below it, a concrete service alley. Beyond the alley, a wall. Ten feet of featureless concrete topped with broken glass embedded in mortar. The apartment complex on the other side had lights in its windows. Normal lights. Kitchen lights and television glow and the flickering orange of jack-o-lanterns.

"I can't—Jane, I can't climb. My leg."

"You can." She knelt beside him, hands on his shoulders. Looked him straight in the eyes. "You have to. We're not staying here."

Something crashed in the corridor behind them. Plaster dust sifted from the ceiling. The walls groaned, that deep architectural sound The Quad made when it rearranged itself. The hallway they'd come through was already different—shorter, the doors in wrong positions, the ceiling lower. A passage that had been ten feet wide was now barely shoulder-width.

And somewhere in that contracting maze, the dog-thing was hunting.

Matt's face crumpled. His breathing hitched, fast and shallow, the edge of hyperventilation. "It's going to find us. It's going to—"

"Matt." Jane grabbed his chin. Forced him to look at her. "We built a torch. We have fire. It doesn't like fire. Remember?"

He nodded. Barely.

The torch lay on the floor beside them—a broken table leg wrapped in strips of a janitor's jacket they'd found in a supply closet. Jane had soaked the fabric in turpentine from a rusted can. The flame burned uneven and smoky, throwing wild shadows that made every surface look alive. The dog-thing had backed away from it. Twice. Three times. Each time snarling, those impossible teeth gnashing, but unwilling to cross into the light.

"I'll go through first," Jane said. "Then I'll pull you up. You push with your good leg. That's all you have to do."

"What about the torch?"

She hesitated. They couldn't carry it through the window and climb at the same time. Leaving it meant crossing the alley and scaling the wall in darkness. With the dog-thing potentially right behind them.

"We move fast," she said. "That's the plan."

Matt let out a sound that was half laugh, half sob. "That's a terrible plan."

"It's the only one we have."

She helped him stand. He screamed when weight hit his left leg—a ragged, animal sound that echoed through the shifting corridors and seemed to multiply, bouncing back from walls that shouldn't have been there. Jane hooked his arm over her shoulders and half-carried him to the window.

The corridor behind them contracted. The ceiling dropped another six inches. A doorway that had been open was now a blank wall. The Quad was digesting the space they'd occupied, collapsing inward like a throat swallowing.

Jane went through the window feet-first, dropping to the concrete below. The impact jarred through her ankles, her knees. She turned, reached up.

"Now you. Sit on the ledge and slide."

Matt's face appeared in the window frame, ghostly pale, his eyes too wide. He gripped the frame with white-knuckled hands and swung his good leg over. His left leg followed, limp, the jeans below the knee soaked dark. He made a sound when it scraped against the brick but didn't scream again. Jane grabbed his waist and guided him down, catching most of his weight.

They collapsed together on the alley floor. Matt gasping. Jane's arms shaking.

Behind them, from the broken window, a sound. Low and thick. A growl that vibrated in the chest more than the ears. The dog-thing's snout appeared in the frame, lips peeled back, gums black, teeth crowded in rows like a shark's. It pressed against the opening, shoulders bunching. Too broad to fit. Its body contorted, bones crackling, flesh reshaping with wet sounds.

"Move." Jane hauled Matt upright. "Move move move."

The wall. They had to get over the wall.

She dragged him across the alley. Twenty feet. His injured leg left a dark trail on the concrete. He hopped on his right, every landing drawing a hiss of pain. The wall loomed ahead of them, ten feet of poured concrete, the top edge bristling with glass shards that caught the moonlight.

Behind them, the dog-thing squeezed through the window. Something in its body popped—a joint dislocating, reconfiguring. It fell to the alley floor in a heap of dark muscle and stood up wrong, limbs at bad angles, jaw hanging loose. Then everything snapped back into place. It shook itself. Focused.

Matt saw it. His whole body went rigid against Jane's side. "Oh god. Oh god, Jane—"

"Don't look. Climb."

The wall had no handholds. No footholds. Just flat concrete. Jane pressed Matt against it, his back to the surface, and laced her fingers together at knee height. "Step up. I'll boost you. Grab the top."

"The glass—"

"Grab between the glass. Go."

He stepped into her hands with his right foot. She pushed upward. Her back screamed. Her arms burned. Matt's weight shifted as he reached, fingers scrabbling at the wall's edge. A grunt. His hand found purchase between two clusters of glass shards.

The dog-thing advanced down the alley. Not running. Walking. Its head low, its too-many teeth bared. Each step precise and deliberate, claws clicking on concrete like a slow countdown.

"Pull!" Jane shoved harder. Matt's other hand found the top. He hauled himself up, his injured leg kicking uselessly, his good leg finding a crack in the concrete and pushing. He rolled onto the wall's flat top, gasping, shaking. Glass cut into his palms, his forearms. He didn't notice.

Jane jumped. Caught the edge. Glass bit into her fingers. She pulled herself up in one motion, fear lending strength she didn't know she had. Below, the dog-thing broke into a sprint—a sudden burst of black muscle crossing the remaining distance in two bounds.

It leaped. Jaws snapping.

Jane kicked. Her foot connected with its skull, deflecting its trajectory. It crashed into the wall below them, fell, scrambled up, leaped again.

Matt rolled off the far side. He fell badly—the drop to the sidewalk on the apartment side was only six feet, but he landed on his injured leg. The scream that tore out of him was worse than all the others. Jane heard bone—or something worse, something already broken grinding against itself.

She dropped beside him. The dog-thing's snarling faded behind the wall. It circled. It looked for another way. The wall held.

For now.

"Matt." She knelt beside him. Blood everywhere. His jeans were saturated from the knee down. A flap of torn denim showed the wound beneath—deep, ragged, the muscle visible and wrong-colored. "Matt, we need to move. We need to get to the street."

He was crying. No sound, just tears cutting through the dirt and sweat on his face. "I can't. I can't walk."

"Then I'll carry you."

She hooked her arms under his and dragged. Across the narrow sidewalk, around the corner of the apartment building, out toward the street. The torch was gone—still burning in The Quad's corridor, probably consumed by now. They had no fire. No light except the streetlamps and the porch lights of oblivious neighbors.

The Quad rose behind them, visible over the wall's edge. Dark windows. Gothic spires. Silent.

Except for that hum. That low harmonic frequency that made Jane's teeth ache and her vision blur at the edges. The building was breathing. Still breathing. Still hungry.

She lowered Matt against the apartment building's outer wall and pressed both hands against his thigh wound. The blood was warm and constant, pulsing against her palms.

"Stay with me," she said. "Someone's going to see us. We're out. We're outside."

The square of sky above them—framed by apartment buildings on all sides—was full of stars and Halloween night. Somewhere inside, trick-or-treaters were counting candy. Somewhere, a party was playing music too loud. Somewhere, people were alive and safe and bored.

And behind the wall, something with too many teeth paced back and forth, patient, waiting for the fire to die.
