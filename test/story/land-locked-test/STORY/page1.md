# Page 1: Through the Gap

The gap in the fence was barely wide enough for a person.

Steve went first, of course. He turned sideways and slid through the narrow space between two sections of chain-link where the bottom had rusted free from its post. His jacket snagged on a wire barb. He yanked it free without looking, leaving a tuft of fabric behind like a flag.

"Come on." He was already across, standing in the overgrown courtyard, his phone flashlight sweeping the facade of The Quad. "You gotta see this."

Jane went next. The wire scratched her arm through her sleeve—a thin line of heat that she'd find later had drawn blood. The courtyard was all weeds and broken concrete, nature slowly digesting the building's territory. Beyond the fence, the apartment buildings rose on all sides, their lit windows staring down like rows of eyes. A balcony on the third floor had a skeleton hanging from it, part of someone's Halloween display. From this angle, silhouetted against the porch light, it looked disturbingly real.

Matt came last. He got stuck. His hip caught on the fence post and he made a small, frustrated sound that was also a little bit afraid.

"Push through," Jane said, holding the chain-link away from him. "You're fine."

"I'm stuck."

"You're not stuck, you're hesitating. Push."

He pushed. The fence released him with a metallic scrape, and he stumbled into the courtyard, straightening his jacket, avoiding eye contact.

The Quad rose above them.

Jane had seen it from outside, from the surrounding streets—everyone in the neighborhood had. A Gothic-style building locked inside a block of modern apartment complexes, no street access, no driveway, no gate. Just this thing, this relic from 1914, trapped. The apartments had been built around it in the seventies, walling it in on all four sides. Nobody had demolished it. Nobody had developed it. It just sat there, landlocked, its stone facades darkening with decades of neglect, its windows either boarded or broken, its roofline a silhouette of spires and chimneys that looked medieval against the suburban skyline.

Up close, it was worse.

The stone was black with soot and mold. Water damage had carved channels down the walls, leaving mineral deposits that glinted in Steve's phone light like veins of quartz. The main entrance—double doors, arched, the frames carved with patterns that might have been decorative or might have been something else—was sealed with plywood. Someone had spray-painted a pentagram on the plywood. Someone else had written DON'T beneath it. A third person had added ENTER in smaller letters, completing the warning that the pentagram artist probably hadn't intended.

Steve tried the plywood. It was nailed solid.

"Side door," Jane said. She'd been reading about The Quad online. Forum posts, Reddit threads, one deeply questionable blog from a paranormal investigator who claimed to have recorded EVPs in the courtyard. The building had been an asylum—a private psychiatric facility that operated from 1914 to 1961. It closed after a fire killed eight patients in the east wing. The fire was ruled accidental. The coroner's reports were sealed. The building was sold to a development company that went bankrupt before breaking ground, and The Quad had been decaying in its concrete cage ever since.

"Over here," Matt called. He'd found the side entrance almost by accident—a service door half-hidden behind a collapsed section of gutter. The door itself was metal, rusted, and slightly ajar. Not forced. Just... open.

Steve pushed it wide. The hinges didn't squeak. They should have—sixty years of neglect and rain and temperature cycles should have seized them solid. They moved smoothly, silently, and the door swung inward to reveal a hallway that swallowed their flashlight beams after ten feet.

"This was a great idea," Matt whispered. His sarcasm had a tremor in it.

They entered.

The hallway stretched ahead, institutional tile underfoot—small hexagons in a pattern of white and green, most cracked, some missing entirely, the subfloor visible beneath. The walls were plaster over brick, painted a shade of institutional green that had faded to something ghostly. Doorways opened on either side at regular intervals, each leading to small rooms—offices, maybe. Examination rooms. Patient rooms. The furniture was mostly gone. A desk here. A chair there. Filing cabinets with their drawers pulled out, emptied decades ago by someone who cared about the contents.

The building smelled like dust and standing water and something underneath—faint, sweet, like flowers rotting in a vase.

Steve documented everything. His phone clicked and clicked, the flash turning corners into brief moments of daylight. Jane followed his light, her own flashlight sweeping ceiling and floor. Matt stayed close to her. Too close. His shoulder kept bumping hers.

"The asylum housed about sixty patients," Jane said. Talking felt better than silence. "Mostly severe cases. Schizophrenia, psychotic episodes. The kind of patients that other facilities turned away."

"Cool," Steve said, not listening.

"The east wing—where the fire happened—was the ward for violent patients. They had padded rooms. Hydrotherapy tanks. Electroshock."

"Super cool."

Matt's hand found her elbow. "Can we maybe not do the horror movie exposition right now?"

They reached a junction. The hallway split into three directions—straight ahead toward what appeared to be a large open space, left toward a staircase going up, right toward a staircase going down. The sweet smell was stronger here. Stronger toward the right.

Steve started right.

"Why down?" Matt's voice cracked on the word. "Why would we go down? In what scenario is down the correct choice?"

"Because that's where the creepy stuff is." Steve was already on the first step. "You don't find ghosts in the attic, bro."

"Actually, that's exactly where—"

"Matt." Jane looked at him. He looked back. His eyes were wide, his body taut, every instinct screaming at him to turn around and squeeze back through that gap in the fence. She understood. She felt it too—a pull in the opposite direction, a weight in her gut telling her that down was wrong.

She went down anyway. Steve needed someone with sense near him, and Jane didn't trust him not to break his neck on a collapsed staircase while trying to get the perfect Instagram shot.

The stairs descended two flights. The air changed as they went deeper—colder, heavier, the sweet smell thickening into something that coated the back of the throat. The walls shifted from plaster to exposed stone, the tile giving way to rough-hewn steps that had been worn smooth in the center by decades of foot traffic. Old foot traffic. The kind of wear that takes generations.

Matt followed. Jane heard his breathing behind her—controlled, deliberate, the breathing of someone managing panic through sheer force of will. Each exhale was a little shakier than the last.

The cellar opened up at the bottom of the stairs.

Jane's flashlight reached into the darkness and found nothing—no far wall, no boundary. Just columns of stone receding into shadow. The ceiling was low, maybe seven feet, supported by wooden beams that had darkened to near-black with age. The floor was packed earth.

And the smell. The sweet, rotting, copper smell. It was coming from everywhere down here. From the earth itself.

Steve walked into the darkness like he owned it.

"Steve." Jane's voice echoed. The acoustics were wrong—her voice came back to her from directions that didn't match the room's geometry. "Steve, wait."

He didn't wait. His light bobbed ahead, getting smaller, and Jane followed it because the alternative was standing in the dark with Matt's panicked breathing and the smell and the silence and the feeling—growing stronger with every second—that the cellar was bigger than the building above it. Much bigger.

And it was breathing.

She felt it against her skin. A slow cycle of pressure changes, like standing inside an enormous lung. Inhale: the air compressed, the sweet smell intensified, her ears popped. Exhale: the pressure dropped, the temperature fell two degrees, the darkness seemed to exhale with it.

The building was breathing.

Matt grabbed her arm. "Jane." His voice was barely audible. "Jane, I want to leave."

"I know," she said. "Me too."

Ahead, Steve's light stopped moving. His voice came back to them, flat with awe.

"Guys. You need to see this."
