The yellow went on forever.

Ash had been walking for what his body said was an hour and his brain said was a week. The corridors looped. Not metaphorically—he'd marked the wall with a scratch from his belt buckle at the first junction, and he'd passed that scratch four times since, each time approaching it from a different direction. The maze rewrote itself between his footsteps, rearranging its infinite, identical hallways the way a card sharp shuffles a deck. Impossible to navigate. Impossible to map. The Backrooms didn't want to be understood.

He'd stopped panicking about twenty minutes in. Panic took energy, and energy was a finite resource in a place where the vending machines were empty shells and the water fountains dispensed something clear and odorless that wasn't quite water. He'd smelled it. Hadn't tasted it. Some instinct, some deeply buried survival algorithm inherited from ancestors who'd lived long enough to reproduce by not drinking things that smelled like nothing in places that smelled like everything, had kept the cup away from his lips.

The boombox helped. He'd found it in the third room—a break room with no coffee, no refrigerator, no evidence that anyone had ever taken a break in it. Just a folding table, two chairs with torn upholstery, and the boombox sitting on the counter like someone had set it down mid-song and walked into the walls. Late-eighties model. Big. The kind of unit that weighed ten pounds and required a shoulder strap for the truly committed. Ash picked it up out of habit. Janitor instinct—if it's on the floor, pick it up. If it's on the counter, put it where it belongs.

There was nowhere it belonged.

The static started in the sixth corridor. Soft. Ambient. A hiss that wove itself into the fluorescent hum until Ash couldn't tell where the lights ended and the sound began. It rose and fell in waves, cycling through frequencies like a radio scanning for a station that didn't exist. He ignored it. The way you ignored construction noise after the first hour, the way you ignored the tinnitus that had lived in his left ear since a firecracker incident in 1992. Background noise. Annoying. Ignorable.

Then it said his name.

Not clearly. Not in a voice he could identify. Just the shape of it buried in the static—"Ash"—the syllable surfacing and submerging like something drowning in white noise. He stopped walking. The corridor stretched ahead, yellow and endless. The static breathed around him.

"Who's there?" His voice sounded thin. Small. A human voice in a place that wasn't built for human voices.

The static answered with more of itself. Layers added to layers. He caught fragments. Numbers—rental codes, late fees, inventory counts from the store. Words in his own cadence, his own inflection, played back at him from a source that had no mouth and no memory. Just recordings. Magnetic impressions of a life lived in the aisles of a dying business, captured on tape and replayed in a void.

"Cassette echoes." He didn't know where the name came from. It arrived in his head fully formed, like it had always been there. Like he'd named them before.

He walked faster.

The echoes followed. They drifted at the edge of hearing, whispering inventories and late-fee notices and one clear, repeated phrase in a voice that sounded like Harold's: "Store's done. Signed yesterday." Over and over. The words losing meaning through repetition, becoming pure sound, pure pressure.

Ash found a fluorescent tube that had fallen from its housing. Long, intact, still faintly warm. He picked it up. Held it like a staff. The residual glow wasn't much—a dying ember in a glass cylinder—and he shook it, trying to coax more light from the filament. It flared. Briefly. The echoes recoiled. Not far. Just enough for him to feel the change in pressure. Light. They didn't like light.

He filed that away.

Three more corridors. The echoes grew bolder. They pressed closer in the dark stretches between functional overhead panels, their whispers sharpening, taking on texture and personality. A woman's voice reading a weather report. A child asking for something he couldn't quite hear. Ash's own voice saying "groovy" in a tone he'd never used, flat and hollow and stripped of everything that made the word his.

The Betamax hulk appeared without warning.

Ash rounded a corner and it was there—filling the corridor, shoulders brushing both walls, its body a compressed slab of dark material that caught the fluorescent light and ate it. The reels where its eyes should have been spun in opposite directions. It didn't move when it saw him. It just stood. Existing. Taking up space the way a boulder takes up a streambed. Immovable. Inevitable.

Ash took a step back. His foot found the edge of a missing carpet tile. His balance wavered. The hulk's reels focused—if that was the word—the spinning slowing, synchronizing, both eyes locking onto him with mechanical precision.

It charged.

The sound was the worst part. Not the footsteps, which shook the floor and rattled the fluorescent tubes in their housings. The sound from inside it—that grinding, distorted roar, like a cassette player eating a tape in slow motion, amplified to concert volume. It filled the corridor. Filled his skull. His teeth vibrated. His vision blurred at the edges.

Ash ran. No quip. No one-liner. Pure animal flight, the boombox banging against his leg, the fluorescent tube clutched in his other hand like a relay baton. The hulk's footsteps drummed behind him—heavy, relentless, gaining. He took the first door he found. Slammed it. Leaned against it.

The door held for three seconds. Then it buckled. Then the frame cracked.

He ran again. Through a room of collapsed cubicles. Through a narrow passage that forced him sideways, the walls pressing his chest and back simultaneously, the boombox scraping the ceiling. Through another corridor that looked like every other corridor and probably was every other corridor.

The hulk's roar faded. Not gone—muffled, redirected, the maze rearranging itself between predator and prey. Ash didn't trust it. He kept running until his lungs burned and his legs felt like wet rope and the only sound was his own ragged breathing and the eternal fluorescent hum.

He doubled over in a junction. Three paths. All identical. All yellow. All leading deeper into nothing.

Blue light.

Faint. Steady. Coming from the leftmost corridor. Not fluorescent blue—LED blue. That specific shade of electric cobalt that lived in the eyes of old consumer electronics, the standby lights on VCR decks and cable boxes and the digital clocks that glowed from nightstands in the dark.

VHS-MAN stood at the end of the corridor.

Not moving. Not fleeing. Just standing. Its body a sculpture of wound tape, the individual strands shifting in slow, constant rotation, adjusting and readjusting like a system maintaining equilibrium. No features except those eyes—twin points of blue light buried in the chest-high tangle of its head, if the smooth, featureless mass of tape at the top of its body qualified as a head. It watched him the way a projector watches a screen. Passive. Attentive. Illuminating.

Ash straightened. His grip tightened on the boombox. The fluorescent tube hummed in his other hand, dimmer now, the filament spending itself.

"You." His voice found its footing. Rough. Angry. Alive. "You started this. That door in the storeroom—your door. Opened it and this whole nightmare kicked off."

VHS-MAN tilted its head. One degree. Two. The tape coils around its neck unwound an inch and wound back, tighter than before. A gesture. The only gesture it seemed to have.

"What are you? Huh?" He took a step closer. Then another. The entity didn't retreat. Didn't advance. Just stood, its eyes pulsing at that steady, hypnotic rhythm. "You're made of the same stuff as those—those whisper things. Same tape. Same plastic. You should be trying to eat me or haunt me or whatever they do. What makes you different?"

The entity's arm moved. Slowly. One tape-wound limb lifting from its side, extending, pointing. Not at Ash. Past him. Down the corridor he'd come from, toward the sound of the Betamax hulk still grinding through the maze, hunting.

Pointing at the threat. Not being one.

The realization hit Ash like a door to the face. This thing—this spectral tangle of magnetic strip with its glowing vintage eyes—wasn't chasing him. It had been in the storeroom. It had been at the threshold. It had been in the first corridor when he'd fallen through. Always present. Never attacking. Standing at distances. Watching from doorways.

Leading.

"You're showing me the way out." He said it aloud, testing the words. They felt right and wrong simultaneously—right in the way that survival instincts are right, wrong in the way that trusting a creature made of dead media in an infinite purgatory of office furniture was definitionally insane. "You can move through doors. Any door. You go where you want. And you're—what? Waiting for me to follow?"

VHS-MAN lowered its arm. The eyes pulsed. The tracking lines rippled through the blue—fast, then slow, fast, then slow. Agreement? Amusement? The emotional bandwidth of a VHS tape was limited.

"Groovy." Ash shifted the boombox to his left hand. Hefted the fluorescent tube in his right. "Lead the way, Blockbuster. I'm right behind you."

The entity turned. Walked to the door at the corridor's end. Passed through it. Gone.

Ash followed. Running now. Chasing what he'd been fleeing from. The absurdity of it—a forty-something janitor in a ruined uniform sprinting through a liminal hellscape after a sentient pile of VHS tape, armed with a boombox and a dying light tube—wasn't lost on him. He laughed. The sound bounced off the yellow walls and came back strange, but this time the strangeness didn't bother him.

He was getting out. Whatever this thing was, wherever it was going, it was the only door that mattered.
