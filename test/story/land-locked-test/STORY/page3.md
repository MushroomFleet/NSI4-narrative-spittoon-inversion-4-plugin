# Page 3: The Dog in the Dark

Jane ran.

The corridor split ahead of her—left into darkness, right into a stairwell that hadn't been there five minutes ago. She chose right. Her sneakers slapped against stone steps, the sound swallowed by the building's constant hum. That low frequency. The one that sat behind her teeth and made everything feel slightly wrong, like vertigo without the spinning.

Steve was dead.

She kept running because stopping meant thinking, and thinking meant seeing it again. The cat-thing. Her fear. Hers. A mangled tabby the size of a German Shepherd, its body twisted and wrong—ribs visible through patchy fur, eyes clouded and milky, jaw hanging at an angle that no living thing should survive. It had come from nowhere. From the darkness near the hellmouth. From her.

It had looked at Steve. Not at her. Not at the person whose fear had birthed it. At Steve, the least frightened person in the room. The one grinning, the one calling it awesome, the one stepping forward with his phone raised like he was going to record it for his socials.

Jane's foot caught a broken step. She stumbled, caught herself against the wall. The plaster crumbled under her fingers, damp and cold. She kept climbing.

"Matt!" Her voice bounced through the stairwell. "Matt, where are you?"

Nothing. The building breathed around her. Walls shifted in her peripheral vision—not dramatically, not the sudden rearrangement she'd witnessed in the cellar, but subtle. A doorframe narrowing. A window disappearing. The architecture digesting itself.

She and Matt had gotten separated in the panic after Steve. After the cat-thing. After the screaming stopped. Matt had bolted one direction, she'd bolted another, and the corridor between them had sealed itself shut like a wound closing.

The stairwell ended at a landing. Two doors. One wooden, one metal. The wooden door hung open, revealing a long ward—rows of rusted bed frames, mattresses reduced to springs and stains. Moonlight filtered through barred windows, casting prison-stripe shadows across the floor.

Jane's phone was dead. Had been for an hour. Something about The Quad killed batteries. Steve had joked about it—electromagnetic interference, he'd said, like he knew what that meant. Like naming the phenomenon gave him power over it.

Steve.

She pressed her palms against her eyes. Breathed.

"Matt!" Louder this time.

A sound from the ward. Not the building. Not the hum. Something smaller. Human. Breathing.

Jane stepped through the doorway. The bed frames lined the walls in two rows, twelve on each side. Most were bare metal. Some still had restraints bolted to the rails—leather straps, darkened and stiff with age. The floor was covered in a fine layer of plaster dust, and in that dust, footprints. Fresh ones. Sneakers. Matt's size.

She followed them down the center aisle. Past beds that looked slept in despite being abandoned for decades. Past a nurses' station with its window shattered inward. Past a utility closet with its door hanging by one hinge.

"Jane?"

Matt's voice. Thin. Shaking. Coming from behind the last bed in the row.

She found him wedged between the bed frame and the wall, his knees pulled to his chest, his arms wrapped around his shins. His eyes were red-rimmed. Snot and tears tracked through the dust on his face. He looked up at her like she was a hallucination he didn't trust.

"Hey." She crouched in front of him. "Hey, it's me. It's okay."

"Steve's dead." His voice was flat. Disconnected. "He's dead, Jane. That thing—your thing—it just—he just—"

"I know."

"We have to get out. We have to—the doors don't go anywhere. I tried three of them. They open into walls. Actual walls. Brick."

Jane sat beside him. Their shoulders touched. She could feel him trembling, constant micro-vibrations like a machine running too fast.

"I found stairs," she said. "We went down to the cellar. That means up goes to the ground floor. There are windows on the ground floor. We break one. We get out."

Matt shook his head. Kept shaking it. "The building moves, Jane. The building moves. I walked down a hallway and ended up in the same room I started in. Three times. It's not—it doesn't follow rules."

"Then we make it follow ours." She stood. Extended her hand. "Come on."

He looked at her hand like it was something dangerous. Then he took it.

They moved together through the ward, heading for the far door. Jane's eyes scanned constantly—walls, ceiling, floor. Everything still. Everything quiet except the hum.

The utility closet they'd passed caught her attention. She stopped. Backed up. Inside: a janitor's cart, rusted solid. A mop with no head. Cleaning supplies in corroded containers. And on a shelf, behind a stack of folded rags that disintegrated at her touch, a metal can. She picked it up. Shook it. Liquid sloshed.

She unscrewed the cap. The smell hit her immediately—sharp, chemical. Turpentine. Or something close to it.

"What are you doing?" Matt hovered in the doorway, his weight shifting constantly, ready to run.

"Fire." Jane grabbed one of the bed legs that had broken loose from a frame. Solid wood, three feet long. She wrapped it with strips torn from the janitor's jacket hanging on the back of the cart. "The hellmouth mechanics—the portal—whatever it is. Fire hurts it. The cellar was full of old torch sconces on the walls. Why put torches underground unless something down there needs light to keep it away?"

Matt stared at her. "That's... actually smart."

"I'm a smart person, Matt."

She doused the fabric in turpentine. Pulled a book of matches from the janitor's jacket pocket—Moretti's Bar and Grill, the cardboard soft with age. Three matches left. She struck the first. It crumbled. The second caught, flared, and she touched it to the soaked fabric.

The torch ignited with a whoosh that singed her eyebrows. Flame crawled up the wrapping, stabilized, burned steady and hot. The light pushed back the shadows, and for the first time since entering The Quad, Jane felt something other than dread.

They made it down one corridor. Then another. The building's layout was nonsensical—a bathroom opened into a kitchen, a kitchen into a surgical theater with drains in the floor and a lamp that still worked somehow, its bulb buzzing and flickering in a room that couldn't possibly have electricity. Jane kept the torch high and chose directions by instinct, always trending toward what felt like the building's exterior wall.

Matt walked beside her. Close. His breathing had steadied some, the torch-light giving him something solid to focus on. He talked—nervous, constant chatter. About his economics professor. About the dining hall food. About anything that wasn't the building or Steve or what had happened in the cellar.

"I used to have this dog," he said. "When I was little. My neighbor's dog. Pitbull mix. It got off its chain one day and came into our yard while I was playing. Just—came at me. No warning. No barking. My dad pulled it off, but I had these scars on my leg for years. I still can't—I can't be around dogs. Any dogs. Even little ones."

Jane didn't respond. Her jaw was clenched. The hellmouth fed on fear. Manifested it. Steve had been fearless—the portal had targeted him first, using her fear to create the weapon. Matt's fear was specific. Primal. Dogs.

The corridor ahead of them widened into an intersection. Four passages, each identical. Jane raised the torch, and the light caught something moving in the leftmost passage.

Low to the ground. Muscular. Dark.

It stepped into the torchlight and Matt made a sound—not a word, not a scream, just a raw exhalation of pure terror. The thing was shin-height, built like a bulldog but stretched and wrong. Its body was all dense muscle under fur that looked wet despite being dry. Its jaw was too wide, hanging open to reveal rows and rows of teeth—not a dog's teeth, not any animal's teeth. Shark teeth. Needle teeth. Teeth that overlapped and jutted at angles, packed so tight they couldn't close properly.

It looked at Matt with black eyes that held no animal intelligence. Just hunger.

"Don't move." Jane thrust the torch forward. The flame guttered, flared. The dog-thing flinched. It retreated three steps, its claws scraping stone, a growl rolling up from its chest that Jane felt in her ribcage.

"Jane." Matt's hand found her arm. His grip was crushing. "Jane, that's—it's my—"

"I know what it is." She swept the torch in a wide arc. The dog-thing backed up further, its lips twitching, its body coiled. "Stay behind me. Stay close."

They edged past the intersection, keeping to the right-hand passage. Jane held the torch between them and the creature. It followed. Patient. Watching. Its claws clicked on the stone floor—tick tick tick—a metronome counting down to something Jane didn't want to think about.

The corridor narrowed. The ceiling dropped. The Quad was shifting again, and this time it was pushing them somewhere specific. Channeling them. Jane's stomach turned when she realized: the building was herding them.

The torch flickered. The turpentine-soaked fabric was burning down. Twenty minutes of flame. Maybe less.

Behind them, the dog-thing followed, close enough now that Jane could smell it—wet fur and copper and something underneath, something sweet and rotten, the same smell from the cellar. From the hellmouth.

Ahead: a corridor with windows. Real windows. Moonlight and streetlamps visible through grime-coated glass. The outside world, close enough to touch.

Matt saw it too. "Jane—"

"I see it."

The dog-thing saw them quicken their pace. It quickened too.

And then it charged.
