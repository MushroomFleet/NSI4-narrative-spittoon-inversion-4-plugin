The storeroom had a door Ash had never opened.

He'd noticed it before—of course he had, three years of mopping floors and shelving returns gave you a pretty comprehensive map of a building's anatomy. It sat in the back corner behind the horror section overflow, a stack of VHS crates that hadn't been sorted since the Clinton administration forming a waist-high barricade in front of it. Gray metal. No window. No label. The kind of door that existed in buildings because buildings had doors, because somewhere on a blueprint in 1987 an architect had drawn a rectangle and labeled it STORAGE or MECHANICAL or NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

Ash had never opened it. The crates were too heavy to bother moving for curiosity's sake. Harold had never mentioned it. The owner—whoever the owner actually was behind three layers of holding companies and a deaf-mute landlord who communicated exclusively through certified letters—had never mentioned it.

Tonight, the crates were on the other side of the room.

He stood in the storeroom doorway, mop in one hand, keys jangling from his belt, and looked at the space where six crates of unsorted horror VHS tapes had been stacked for three years. The floor where they'd sat was a different color—lighter, cleaner, a rectangle of carpet that hadn't been exposed to foot traffic or fluorescent yellowing. Like a painting had been removed from a wall, leaving its ghost behind.

The crates sat across the room. Neatly. Aligned with the wall. Labels facing out. As if someone had decided to reorganize at three in the morning and had done it with the quiet precision of a person who didn't want to be heard.

"Harold?" Ash called toward the front. The store was empty. Harold had left at nine. The last customer—the kid with the hoodie returning a scratched copy of something—had been gone for an hour. Ash was alone. Had been alone since he'd locked the front door and started his final sweep.

The door stood exposed. Gray metal under fluorescent light. No handle on this side. Just a keyhole, old-fashioned, the kind that took a skeleton key. And something else. Something Ash had never seen because the crates had always been in the way.

Scratches.

Deep ones. Carved into the metal surface in a pattern that might have been random and might have been deliberate. Some were short and parallel—claw marks or fingernail tracks. Others were longer, curving, gouging through the paint to bare steel beneath. They radiated out from the keyhole like sunburst lines on a compass rose, and at the center, around the lock itself, the metal was worn smooth. Polished. As if someone had spent years turning a key in that lock. Turning it and turning it and turning it.

Ash's keys were on his belt. Twelve keys on a ring—front door, back door, register, supply closet, circuit breaker box, seven he'd never identified and Harold had never explained. Janitor inheritance. "Some of those are from before my time," Harold had said when he'd handed over the ring on Ash's first day. "Don't worry about 'em."

Ash tried the first unidentified key. Wrong size. Second. Wrong shape. Third. Wouldn't turn. Fourth—

Click.

The sound was louder than a single lock mechanism should have produced. It resonated. The storeroom walls caught it and held it, and for a second the fluorescent tubes dimmed, the light dropping from institutional white to a deep, pulsing amber before snapping back. The hum of the building—the normal hum, the refrigerator-and-HVAC hum that every commercial space produced—shifted. Dropped a register. Sat in a frequency that Ash felt in his jaw more than heard.

He pulled the key out. Put his palm flat against the door. The metal was warm. Not from the room—the storeroom was cool, air-conditioned, the same sixty-eight degrees it always was. The door was warm from the other side. Heat pushing through the steel.

"This is a bad idea." He said it out loud. Heard it. Acknowledged it. His hand found the edge of the door—no handle meant leverage from the frame, fingertips in the gap between door and jamb—and he pulled.

The door opened.

Yellow.

The color hit him before anything else. A wall of yellow light, warm and sickly, the color of old paper and nicotine stains and the jaundiced glow of a monitor with bad color calibration. It poured through the doorframe and pooled on the storeroom floor, and in it Ash could see dust motes—millions of them, swirling in lazy spirals, lit golden by the light from a place that shouldn't have existed behind a door in a strip-mall video store.

The smell came second. Damp carpet and stale air and something underneath—ozone, maybe. The tang of electricity. The specific plastic-and-chemical scent that VHS tapes produced when they decomposed, when the magnetic coating broke down and the binding agents released their stored chemicals into the air. Ash knew that smell. He'd been breathing a diluted version of it for three years, surrounded by a store full of dying tapes. This was the concentrated version. The source.

He stepped through.

The floor was carpet. Brown. Damp. The fibers compressed under his boot with a soft, wet sound. The ceiling was acoustic tile, eight feet up, stained with water damage in patterns that looked like continents on a map nobody had drawn. Fluorescent tubes stretched in every direction—not the store's tubes, which were modern T8 sleek things mounted in recessed fixtures. These were old. T12 tubes, fat and buzzing, some of them flickering at frequencies that made his vision swim. They hung from the ceiling in rows that receded into a distance his eyes couldn't find the end of.

He was in a corridor. Yellow walls. Brown carpet. Fluorescent lights. The corridor went forward. It went left. It went right. It didn't go back.

Ash turned around. The door was closed. The storeroom was gone.

"No." He grabbed the door. Gray metal, same as before. No handle on this side either. No keyhole. He pushed. Flat surface, immovable, set into the yellow wall as if it had been poured into the plaster. He slammed his palm against it. The sound didn't echo—the corridor swallowed it, absorbed it into the carpet and the walls and the humming lights.

"No no no—" He hit the door with both hands. The metal didn't even vibrate. It was part of the wall now. Part of the space. As if the corridor had always been here and the door was just a decoration, a memory of an exit that had never existed.

The fluorescents hummed. The carpet squelched under his shifting feet. The yellow light pressed against his eyes from every direction, shadowless and flat, turning the world into a photograph of a place that shouldn't exist.

Ash stood still. Breathing. His heart rate was up—he could feel it in his throat, in his wrists, in the tips of his fingers where they rested against the dead door. The mop was gone. Left behind in the storeroom. In the real world. In the place with customers and Harold and a parking lot and a truck that needed an oil change and a life that, while not spectacular, had the significant advantage of making sense.

He had the keys. The boombox—no. He didn't have a boombox. He had a ring of keys and a belt and a gray polo shirt with the store logo embroidered on the breast pocket. That was it. His entire inventory.

"Okay." He turned away from the door. Faced the corridor. Yellow walls. Brown carpet. Infinite lights. "Okay, Ash. You've seen this movie. You know how this goes."

He didn't. Not really. But he knew movies. Three years of shelving them, rewinding them, reading the box art during slow shifts. He knew the rules. Rule one: don't split up. Easy—he was alone. Rule two: don't investigate the noise. Harder, given that the noise was everywhere. Rule three—

Something moved at the end of the corridor.

Not a shape he could define. A shift in the light. A compression of the yellow glow, as if something had passed between two fluorescent panels and created a momentary shadow. There and gone. The corridor empty again. The carpet undisturbed.

Ash's hand found the keys on his belt. Metal. Familiar. The teeth of seven unknown keys bit into his palm when he gripped them.

He started walking.

The corridor stretched ahead, identical to itself in every direction, and somewhere in its depths the fluorescent hum took on an undertone—lower, rhythmic, the sound of tape running through a machine—and the yellow light seemed to breathe.
