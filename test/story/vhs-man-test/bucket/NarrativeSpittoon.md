# Narrative Spittoon Framework: Implicit Causality

## Core Principle

The Narrative Spittoon method eliminates explicit causal connectors ("because," "but," "therefore") to create more immersive, show-don't-tell narratives. Instead of telling readers why something happens, you show the conditions that make it inevitable.

## The Three Forbidden Words

### 1. "Because" (Explicit Causation)
**Don't:** "She walked faster because she heard footsteps behind her."
**Do:** "Footsteps echoed behind her. She quickened her pace."

### 2. "But" (Explicit Contradiction)
**Don't:** "He wanted to trust her, but something felt wrong."
**Do:** "He wanted to trust her. His hand moved to the weapon at his side."

### 3. "Therefore" (Explicit Conclusion)
**Don't:** "The data was corrupted, therefore the mission failed."
**Do:** "The screen went dark. The mission parameters vanished. The ship drifted."

## Application Guidelines

### Show Through Sequence
Let actions and consequences speak for themselves through temporal proximity:
- Place cause and effect near each other
- Let readers make the connection
- Trust your audience's intelligence

### Reveal Through Details
Replace explanatory text with sensory details:
- Body language reveals emotion
- Environmental changes show consequences
- Character actions demonstrate motivation

### Build Through Implication
Create narrative momentum through:
- **Setup**: Establish conditions
- **Pressure**: Introduce complications
- **Response**: Show character reactions
- **Consequence**: Reveal outcomes

## Story Generation Rules

1. **No Exposition Dumps**: Reveal information through action and dialogue
2. **Trust the Reader**: They can infer causation from juxtaposition
3. **Use Sensory Details**: Show physical reality, not abstract explanations
4. **Character Reactions**: Let characters respond naturally to events
5. **Temporal Flow**: Place related events close together in narrative time

## The Inversion Method

When writing in reverse (page 5 → page 0):
- Start with the resolution (page 5)
- Each previous page asks: "What made this necessary?"
- Show the conditions that led to the next page
- Never explain why events connect—demonstrate the connection through detail

## Quality Checks

Does your text contain:
- ❌ "because" / "since" / "as" (causal)
- ❌ "but" / "however" / "although" (contrasting)
- ❌ "therefore" / "thus" / "consequently" (conclusive)
- ❌ "in order to" / "so that" (purpose)

If yes, rewrite using implicit causality.

## Advanced Techniques

### Juxtaposition
Place contrasting or causal elements in adjacent sentences without connecting them:
"The lock clicked. His shoulders relaxed."

### Behavioral Evidence
Show internal state through external action:
"She smiled at the question. Her hand found the knife."

### Environmental Response
Let the world react to events:
"The alarm fell silent. Smoke curled from the ventilation shaft."
