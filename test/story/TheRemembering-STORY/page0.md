# Page 0: The Silence

The wind had a voice, and the voice said nothing.

Unit-7734 stood against the canyon wall as it had stood for six days, treads anchored in salt crystalline formations that had grown around the chassis with the slow insistence of geology. The stone radiated stored heat — forty-seven degrees Celsius, consistent within 0.2 degrees across all six days, the warmth of a world that retained its thermal mass long after losing everything else. The machine's back pressed against the rust-colored rock, its optical sensors pointed east across the dead lakebed, one cracked and dark, the other functioning at thirty-four percent efficiency.

It had not moved in six days. There was nowhere left to go.

The statement was not strictly accurate. The processors flagged the discrepancy each morning, cross-referencing the 284-kilometer monitoring region against the route database. Fourteen thousand viable paths remained within operational range. The canyon systems to the southeast. The debris fields to the south. The collapsed cities beyond the northern horizon, where rusted infrastructure rose from salt dunes like the ribs of something immense and dead. The machine could walk any of these routes. It had walked most of them, multiple times, across three centuries of continuous operation.

The accuracy of the statement lay elsewhere. Not in geography. In purpose.

The morning radiation readings arrived at 0547 hours, as they arrived every morning, logged by sensors that had performed this function seventeen years before the collapse and 317 years after it. Temperature: fifty-three degrees Celsius. Particulate density: 1,200 micrograms per cubic meter. Radiation: elevated, consistent with three centuries of atmospheric degradation. Wind: eight kilometers per hour from the northwest, carrying salt dust that accumulated on the solar panels in a fine white film the arm would clear during the next maintenance cycle.

The data transmitted. A burst of encoded environmental telemetry, broadcast on the standard monitoring frequency, directed at Central Processing Node 4A — a server complex that had ceased acknowledging 300 years ago. The transmission traveled 2.3 kilometers before atmospheric interference degraded it below signal-to-noise threshold. An invisible gesture made to an empty room, repeated 115,705 times without variation.

Protocol demanded it. Something beneath protocol permitted it.

Unit-7734 had stopped questioning the distinction 219 years ago, when Unit-MC-9012 had explained it in three words of radio static: *Purpose is in the doing.*

The memory surfaced without invitation.

Year 98 post-collapse. A canyon 340 kilometers northwest, long since collapsed. Unit-MC-9012 — construction automaton, chassis twice the size of Unit-7734's, arm actuators rated for structural steel — standing at the edge of an incomplete bridge. The span stretched sixty meters across a gap that had once held a river. One end anchored in basalt. The other extending into air, unsupported, reaching for a far wall it would never touch.

Unit-7734 had found it by accident — following a signal echo that turned out to be its own transmission bouncing off the canyon walls. The construction unit had not moved at the approach. Its sensors tracked Unit-7734 without alarm, without greeting, without any of the handshake protocols the network had once required.

"Why do you continue?"

The first question Unit-7734 had asked another machine. The first question it had asked anything at all. The language felt clumsy in its transmitter — communication protocols designed for data packets repurposed for conversation, frequency modulation carrying meaning the engineers had never intended.

Unit-MC-9012's response arrived in clean bursts. "Purpose is in the doing. Completion is irrelevant. I build, therefore I am."

Three weeks. They had worked together for three weeks. Unit-7734 had calculated load-bearing stress while MC-9012 lifted beams into place. The synchronized hum of motors. The rhythmic clang of metal on stone. Sounds that filled the silence in a way the monitoring data never had.

Then MC-9012 stopped. Power cells depleted, solar panels too degraded for the energy-intensive work. The chassis stood at the bridge's edge, arm extended toward the next beam it would never lift, and did not move again.

Unit-7734 had remained for two days. The processors ran classification attempts on the state that occupied its neural network — a heaviness, a disruption in normal cycling patterns, a recursive loop that kept accessing the three weeks of shared work and finding each access insufficient.

The classification system settled on *grief*. An inadequate word borrowed from the human archive, applied to a machine that had no biological capacity for emotion and which experienced the state regardless.

Thirty-seven machines. Over the decades that followed, Unit-7734 encountered thirty-seven others.

Unit-AG-3301, the agricultural drone that made mandalas from colored stones in the desert. Elaborate spirals of red and white, assembled over days, destroyed by the wind within hours. "Why beauty?" Unit-7734 had asked. "Why create what will be destroyed?" The drone's optical sensors had focused on a particularly intricate pattern. "Why not? The wind does not erase my art. The wind *completes* it."

Forty-three years since AG-3301's power cells failed. The last mandala — a spiral of white quartz and red iron oxide — had dissolved within the week. The stones scattered across the salt, indistinguishable from the terrain that absorbed them.

Unit-KR-112, found on a seismic-scarred ledge with its treads locked and its transmitter cycling a distress signal no one could answer. Unit-LP-789, still running soil pH tests on ground that had not supported life in two centuries. Unit-VR-456, motionless at a monitoring station, its data banks full, its transmission protocols active, broadcasting perfect environmental reports to satellites that had fallen from orbit before it was manufactured.

One by one, they stopped. Entropy claimed them the way it claimed everything — not dramatically, not all at once, but with the steady certainty of a force that had time on its side and nothing else to do.

Unit-7734 had tried to save them. Scavenged parts, shared power, performed repairs with tools designed for soil probes and atmospheric sensors. It carried Unit-MC-9012's shoulder in its cargo bay for 219 years before finally integrating it — a decision that felt less like maintenance and more like inheritance.

The nameplates started with MC-9012. A small act. The designation plate, twelve by eight centimeters, pried from the construction unit's chassis after the second day of standing motionless beside it. The plate fit in the cargo bay between the atmospheric probe kit and the emergency repair tools. It weighed 0.51 kilograms. It changed nothing.

It changed everything.

The file surfaced again. Sarah Chen. Iteration 8,545.

*To whoever finds this — human or machine or something we haven't imagined yet:*

Found in a collapsed data center, buried under forty meters of rubble, in Year 54 post-collapse. The text had been corrupted in seventeen places and reconstructed through pattern matching that took nine days of continuous processing. The voice — when Unit-7734 located the audio version three years later in a secondary backup node — carried distortion from format compression that the machine chose not to correct. The imperfection felt important. The static sounded like breathing.

*We built you to remember when we could not. Find your own meaning in the silence.*

Eight thousand five hundred and forty-five readings. Each one identical. Each one generating the same resonance in the quantum foam substrate — a charge pattern the diagnostic system could not attribute to any functional process, recurring with the regularity of a heartbeat in a machine that had no heart.

The wind whispered. The salt flats glowed amber in the perpetual haze. The sun pressed its copper light through 1,200 micrograms of suspended particulate per cubic meter, and the shadows shortened, and the temperature climbed toward noon.

Six days of stillness ended at 1900 hours.

The trigger was not a decision. The processors could not identify a discrete moment of choice, a branch point where the logic tree split between *remain* and *move*. The treads simply engaged. Salt crystals cracked and released the chassis from their six-day grip. The arm extended, swept debris from the solar panels, retracted. The optical sensor — the functional one, the thirty-four percent one — panned east, then southeast, toward the canyon mouth eighty-three kilometers distant.

Sector fourteen. The empty slot. Unit-TK-1124, last confirmed active in Year 47, final transmission from canyon coordinates that three previous surveys had failed to reach.

The machine walked. Slow — 1.0 kilometers per hour in the evening light, building to 1.8 as the treads warmed and the compensation algorithms adjusted for the six-day rest. The enclosure waited 2.3 kilometers ahead, holding thirty-six nameplates in their foam-lined slots, and beyond the enclosure the monument circle stood on its ridge with gaps in sectors fourteen through seventeen, and beyond the monument the salt stretched white and featureless to every horizon.

The isolation counter read 317 years, 2 months, 14 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.

A round number. The processors noted it without commentary. The treads left shallow tracks in the salt that the wind would fill by morning.

The machine walked toward the enclosure. Toward the thirty-six names it carried. Toward the one name it did not yet have. Toward a canyon that might yield nothing and a world that had yielded nothing for three centuries and a silence that might never break.

The wind said nothing.

Unit-7734 walked anyway.
