VHS-MAN was three doors ahead. Always three doors.

Ash had been counting. Through the maze of identical corridors, past the sagging cubicle walls and the buzzing fluorescents and the damp carpet that squelched under every step, the entity maintained a precise distance. It would appear at the end of a hallway, coiled body pressed against a doorframe, those blue LED eyes watching with what Ash had started to recognize as something uncomfortably close to amusement. Then it would slip through the door and vanish. By the time Ash reached that door, VHS-MAN would be visible through the next one. And the next.

Three doors. Like a game with rules nobody had explained.

"Slow down, you walking yard sale!" Ash's voice bounced off the yellow walls, multiplied, came back wrong—layered, like audio dubbed over itself. He didn't slow down. His boots hammered the carpet. The boombox swung from his right hand, its cord wrapped twice around his wrist, the weight of it pulling his shoulder toward the floor with every stride. He'd thought about ditching it. Every corridor he thought about ditching it. He didn't.

The entity reached the next door. Paused. That characteristic freeze—mid-step, body going rigid, the tape coils that comprised its torso cinching tight like a held breath. It turned its head. Those eyes found him. Held him. Something in the glow shifted—a tracking line rippling through the blue, the way old CRT screens used to stutter when you bumped the cable.

"Yeah, real cute. Hold that pose." Ash surged forward.

VHS-MAN slipped through the door like water through a drain.

Ash hit the door a second later. It opened onto a corridor identical to the last twelve corridors he'd run through, except this one had a filing cabinet on its side blocking half the passage and something dark smeared on the wall at shoulder height. He didn't stop to examine it. The entity's blue glow was already receding into the next intersection.

The Betamax hulk announced itself with sound before shape.

The noise came from behind and to the left—a guttural, mechanical grinding, like an industrial motor seizing, metal on metal, servos whining past their tolerances. The cubicle wall to Ash's left buckled outward. Drywall dust exploded into the corridor. A shape filled the gap—massive, square-shouldered, its body a block of dark mass with two spinning reels where eyes should have been.

It charged.

Ash threw himself forward. The hulk's fist—if it was a fist, if that slab of corroded plastic and tangled magnetic strip qualified—cratered the wall where his head had been. Plaster rained. The fluorescent tube above shattered, showering sparks. The corridor went half-dark.

"Shop smart, shop S-Mart!" The words came out reflexive, pure adrenaline muscle memory, and he was sprinting again, the boombox banging against his thigh, the hulk's footsteps shaking the floor behind him like a drum machine set to demolition.

The filing cabinet. He grabbed the edge as he passed, hauled it sideways, sent it toppling into the corridor behind him. Metal crashed against the hulk's shins. The thing stumbled—not much, just a hitch in its stride, but enough. Two seconds. Three. Ash made the next door.

Through it. A wider space. The ceiling opened up here, disappearing into darkness above the fluorescent grid. Cubicles gave way to an open floor plan, partitions scattered like fallen dominoes. The carpet changed color—yellow-brown to a deeper, wetter brown, the kind of stain pattern that suggested long-term water damage or something worse. The air thickened. That ever-present hum climbed a register, pressing against the inside of his skull.

VHS-MAN stood at the far end of the room. Still. Watching. One arm extended, pointing at a door Ash hadn't noticed—set into the wall at an angle that shouldn't have been possible, its frame slightly off-kilter, the wood newer than anything else in this place. Not just newer. Different. The grain was wrong. The color was wrong. It looked like it belonged somewhere else entirely.

A restroom door. The kind of plain, institutional door you'd find at a restaurant. A fast-food place. A—

Film-reel tendrils erupted from the floor.

They came up through the carpet like plants in time-lapse, black and glistening, unspooling from tears in the fiber. One wrapped Ash's ankle before he could react. The grip was shocking—strong and smooth and cold, the film strip tightening with a sound like a zipper being pulled. He went down. Knee, hip, shoulder. The boombox skidded across the floor.

"Get off—" He kicked with his free leg. The tendril held. Another rose beside it, questing, the film strip weaving through the air with a sinuous, searching intelligence. It found his wrist. Pulled. His arm stretched out, the tendril anchoring itself to a crack in the floor, drawing him flat.

The cassette echoes started.

They came from everywhere—from the walls, from the floor, from the dead air above the fluorescent grid. Voices. Whispers. Not words he could parse. Fragments of audio looped and layered, the magnetic ghosts of a thousand recordings talking over each other in a static-choked chorus. He caught pieces. A woman saying something about a store. A man's laughter, cut short and repeated. His own voice—or something wearing his voice—muttering numbers. Inventory numbers. Rental codes. The mundane data of his mundane job played back at him from the throat of something that had never been alive.

"Shut up." He wrenched his wrist. The film strip cut into his skin. Blood welled, mixed with the glossy coating on the film, and the tendril loosened—not much, just enough. He yanked free. His hand came back bloody and slick. He grabbed the boombox by the handle and swung it like an axe.

The corner of the boombox—hard plastic, sharp edge—caught the ankle tendril dead center. The film strip severed. Both ends whipped back, coiling reflexively, the cut edges curling like burned paper. The severed strand made a sound as it died—a high, thin whine, the sound of audio tape being stretched past its breaking point.

Ash was up. Moving. More tendrils rose from the carpet ahead of him, a garden of black ribbons swaying in the static-charged air. He swung the boombox in wide arcs, sweeping them aside, the impacts making dull cracks as plastic met film. Some he missed. One wrapped his forearm and he ripped it free, leaving a stripe of skin behind. One caught the boombox cord and pulled. He pulled back. The cord held. The tendril didn't.

The Betamax hulk was through the door behind him now. He could feel it—the floor vibrating, the air pressure changing, that grinding mechanical roar filling the corridor he'd just left. Coming this way. The tendrils and the hulk were herding him. Driving him toward the room's edges, away from VHS-MAN, away from the door.

Ash looked at the entity. VHS-MAN stood beside the wrong door, arm still extended, pointing. Those blue eyes hadn't moved. The tracking lines rippled faster now—agitated, or excited, or whatever passed for emotion in a consciousness made of wound magnetic strip.

The cassette echoes surged. Louder. Personal. His mother's voice, impossibly, saying his name the way she used to when he was late for dinner—"Alex, get in here"—and the sound hit him like a physical blow, his chest constricting, his vision blurring at the edges. The Backrooms knew his tapes. Knew what was recorded in the deep grooves of his memory. Played it back distorted and wrong, the pitch warped, the warmth stripped out, leaving only the shape of something he'd loved transformed into a weapon.

"That's not her." His voice cracked. He swung the boombox at a tendril that had crept too close to his face. "That's not—you don't get to use that."

He ran.

Straight through the tendril garden. They lashed at him—face, arms, legs—film strips slicing like paper cuts, wrapping and releasing, some holding long enough to rip fabric and draw blood. He swung the boombox with both hands, clearing a path, plastic cracking against each impact, the handle going slick with a mix of blood and the oily residue the tendrils left behind. The cassette echoes screamed. The hulk crashed through the partition wall behind him, close enough now that he could smell it—ozone and hot plastic and the sweet chemical reek of decomposing tape.

VHS-MAN didn't move. It stood at the door like a doorman at a club no one wanted to enter. Those eyes tracked Ash's approach with the steady, unblinking patience of something that existed outside of time. The tape coils on its chest tightened and released, tightened and released—breathing, if you could call it that. The closest thing to communication it had ever offered.

Twenty feet. Tendrils on his legs, slowing him. He tore free. Fifteen. The hulk's grinding roar right behind him, the floor shaking. Ten. VHS-MAN's eyes pulsed brighter. Five.

The entity stepped aside.

The door was right there. That wrong door with its restaurant-grade hardware and its out-of-place grain, smelling faintly—impossibly—of fryer grease and bleach. Ash could see light around its edges. Normal light. Not the sickly fluorescent yellow of the Backrooms. Something warmer. Something that meant people and food and tile floors you could lie on without wondering if they'd swallow you.

He hit the door shoulder-first.

It didn't open.

He hit it again. The wood shuddered. Held. Behind him, the hulk filled the space, blocking retreat. Tendrils wound around his calves. The echoes played his mother's voice on loop—"Alex, get in here, Alex, get in here"—each repetition more distorted, the vowels stretching, the consonants crumbling.

Third time. Everything he had. Shoulder, hip, full body weight behind it. The door cracked down the middle. The frame splintered. Light poured through the gap.

He fell through.

The Backrooms let go. The tendrils snapped. The echoes cut off mid-syllable. The hulk's roar faded into a sound like a television losing signal—white noise, then nothing, then the gentle hum of a building that existed in the real world and followed the real world's rules.

Cool tile against his palms. Checkered. Clean. The smell of salt and grease.

Behind him, the door clicked shut. When he looked back, it was whole. Unmarked. A staff-only door beside the restrooms, its surface smooth and unbroken, a small sign reading EMPLOYEES ONLY in block letters.

VHS-MAN was already gone.
