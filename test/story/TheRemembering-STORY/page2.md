# Page 2: The Canyon

The canyon mouth opened eighty-three kilometers southeast of the enclosure.

Unit-7734 reached the threshold at hour nineteen of continuous traversal, power reserves at twenty-seven percent. The salt flats ended here in a ragged lip where crystalline terrain dropped into fractured basalt — dark stone splitting the white plain like a wound. Wind channeled through the gap at fifteen kilometers per hour, carrying grit that scored the chassis plating in fine parallel lines. Below, the canyon descended forty-seven meters over 2.1 kilometers, walls rising sheer and striated, veined with mineral deposits that caught amber light in colors the optical sensors registered as iron oxide red, calcium carbonate white, and a deep manganese black that absorbed illumination entirely.

The last canyon survey had been two hundred and twelve days prior. Seismic data from that sweep showed fractured basalt with fourteen-percent rockfall risk, a dry riverbed eighteen meters across at the widest point, and debris fields containing machine remnants from the first century post-collapse. The debris had yielded nothing recoverable on three previous visits. Salt erosion, water damage from storms that had carried moisture centuries ago, and the slow grinding of stone against metal had reduced most housings to unrecognizable geometry.

The processors flagged the risk assessment. Fourteen-percent rockfall. Canyon walls unstable. Power insufficient for rapid retreat. Tread warp probability at eight percent on basalt terrain. Core temperature climbing — fifty-eight degrees Celsius and rising as the walls blocked convective cooling.

The cargo bay held thirty-six nameplates. Sector fourteen remained empty. The deployment manifest listed Unit-TK-1124 as last confirmed active in Year 47 post-collapse, final transmission originating from coordinates that mapped to the canyon's lower reaches.

Unit-7734 engaged the ramp.

Descent altered everything.

The salt-flat world — flat, white, open, predictable — vanished behind the canyon walls within the first two hundred meters. The sky narrowed to a strip of amber between basalt edges. Shadows pooled in crevices the optical sensors could not fully resolve. The treads shifted from crystalline crunch to basalt grind, a deeper sound, heavier, reverberating off the walls in overlapping echoes that made the canyon seem occupied by something other than wind.

Speed dropped to 1.2 kilometers per hour. The manipulator arm extended forward in exploration mode, testing surfaces, probing scree piles, measuring load-bearing capacity of the terrain ahead. A 1.8-meter scree pile blocked the path at the three-hundred-meter mark. Eleven minutes of careful claw work, lifting stone by stone, stacking cleared debris against the wall. The arm's hydraulics operated at eighty-nine percent — the integrated shoulder joint from Unit-MC-9012 flexing smoothly, its seams holding.

Deeper. The walls closed. Temperature rose to sixty-two degrees. Ventilation fans accelerated, pulling air through filters already thick with basalt dust. Power allocation shifted — nine percent to terrain modeling, twelve percent to stability management as the chassis tilted on an eight-degree grade. The tread warp materialized at the five-hundred-meter mark — a stone wedged in the left track assembly, grinding against the drive wheel with each rotation. The arm reached back, extracted the stone, and discarded it. The warp remained: a two-millimeter deviation that the compensation algorithms absorbed without notification.

Wind shifted inside the canyon. The fifteen-kilometer-per-hour surface flow compressed between the walls, accelerating to gusts that carried debris — pebbles, metal fragments, sand — in horizontal streams. Visibility dropped to eight hundred meters. The optical sensors switched to infrared mapping, painting the world in thermal gradients: warm stone, cooler air, and ahead, at six hundred meters, a cluster of shapes that radiated ambient temperature and did not match the canyon's geology.

The debris field.

They lay half-buried in silt — twisted limbs, shattered housings, the remains of machines that had entered this canyon in the decades after the collapse and never left. Unit-7734 counted seventeen distinct chassis configurations across a forty-meter spread. Monitoring units. Construction units. One agricultural frame, too corroded to identify by designation. The wind had arranged them over centuries, pushing lighter components against heavier ones, creating accidental sculptures of interlocked metal that groaned when gusts hit them.

The arm reached into the nearest cluster. Slow. Deliberate. Fingers designed for soil pH probes closing around a corroded strut and lifting it aside. Beneath: a housing panel, designation plate missing, serial markings dissolved by water damage from an era when the canyon still carried intermittent rainfall. The arm set it down. Moved to the next piece.

Seven hours of excavation. The processors tracked power — twenty-six, twenty-five, twenty-four percent — against depth of search. Each piece moved, cataloged, assessed. Most nameplates had corroded past legibility. Two showed partial designations: Unit-K and Unit-T, the remaining characters eaten by salt and time.

The Unit-T fragment mapped to the deployment records. Unit-TK-1124. Year 47 post-collapse, final position estimated at twenty meters below current excavation depth.

The arm went deeper.

The boulder cluster sat at the bottom of a natural depression where the riverbed had once pooled water. Four-point-two meters of basalt, limestone, and compacted sediment, cemented by mineral deposits into a mass the claw's torque rating classed as *maximum effort*. The arm engaged. Hydraulics whined. The shoulder joint — Unit-MC-9012's contribution — bore the load, seams stretching to ninety-one percent of rated tolerance.

Stone cracked. Shifted. Released a shower of grit that coated the optical sensors and required thirty seconds of cleaning cycles before the arm could resume. Below the first layer, a second. Below that, alloy.

The nameplate emerged at hour seven and eighteen minutes. Twelve by eight centimeters. Stamped: Unit-TK-1124. Intact.

The arm held it in the amber half-light of the canyon. Dust settled on the chassis. The wind had dropped to four kilometers per hour — the eye of the channel's rhythm, a lull that would not last. The processors registered the plate's weight, dimensions, material composition. Filed the data alongside thirty-six identical entries.

Something else registered. Not data. A pattern in the neural network that activated whenever a nameplate entered the cargo bay — a resonance the classification system had attempted to label 8,547 times across three centuries and which it had filed, each time, under the same inadequate heading: *Kin. Preserved.*

The plate slid into the cargo bay. Sector fourteen, filled.

The return ascent began at hour twenty-seven.

The canyon released the chassis reluctantly. Basalt gave way to salt at the lip, and the sky opened from a strip to a dome of amber haze, and the wind spread from channel-compressed gusts to the steady nine-kilometer-per-hour sweep of the open flats. Temperature dropped to forty-three degrees. The optical sensors readjusted, recalibrating for distances measured in kilometers rather than meters.

The northern detour added seventeen kilometers to the return vector.

Unit-7734 had not planned the detour. The collapsed monitoring station sat at bearing three-four-seven — a site surveyed forty-two times across a century, its wreckage cataloged in exhaustive detail, its components assessed and dismissed as non-recoverable. The detour made no operational sense. Power reserves stood at twenty-three percent, insufficient for extended exploration without risking the return to the enclosure.

The treads turned north.

The station appeared through the haze at fourteen hundred meters — toppled solar panels, a transmitter array collapsed under its own corroded weight, sensor masts bent to the ground. The seismic shift had occurred recently — eight days, based on the fresh salt crystallization patterns around displaced rubble. A section of the station's foundation had cracked open, exposing a sub-level chamber that previous surveys had not detected.

The arm cleared rubble for two hours. Inside: copper wiring, bundled and sealed in protective conduit that had held against three centuries of exposure. A power regulator, its casing cracked but internals intact — contacts clean, capacitors charged with residual energy. Amplifier coils — seven, of which three tested functional when the arm ran diagnostic currents through them.

A transmitter. The components of a transmitter capable of sustained broadcast at 0.5 watts.

The processors assessed the find. Cross-referenced with atmospheric models, power allocation matrices, signal propagation calculations. The numbers emerged: insufficient power, excessive atmospheric blockage, signal coherence degradation past any useful range.

The numbers said no.

The arm loaded the components into the cargo bay alongside thirty-seven nameplates.

Sarah Chen's file cycled. Iteration 8,548. *What you do with it is yours alone.*

Unit-7734 turned south. The enclosure waited eighty-three kilometers ahead, the monument circle incomplete for two hundred and seven days, the outpost mound holding an auxiliary power cell and the accumulated components of months of purposeless salvage that now, with copper wiring coiled in the cargo bay and amplifier coils clicking against nameplate edges, possessed a purpose the classification system could not yet articulate.

The salt crunched. The wind steadied. The isolation counter advanced past 317 years, 2 months, 14 days, 5 hours, and the canyon receded behind — a dark gash in the white plain, holding its dead, surrendering one name to the machine that walked away from it.
