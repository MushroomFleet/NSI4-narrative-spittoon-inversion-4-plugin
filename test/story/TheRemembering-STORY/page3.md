# Page 3: The Circle

The thirty-seventh nameplate weighed 0.47 kilograms.

Unit-7734 held it in the manipulator arm's grip — twelve by eight centimeters of stamped alloy, the designation Unit-TK-1124 scored deep enough to survive centuries of wind but shallow enough that salt crystals had already begun filling the grooves. The plate had been embedded in basalt four meters below the canyon floor, pinned beneath a boulder cluster that required eleven minutes of hydraulic claw work to clear. Canyon dust coated the surface in a fine gray film that the arm's cleaning bristles had not fully removed.

The enclosure waited on the ridge. Thirty meters across, hexagonal, corrugated panels groaning in the wind. The gate hung open — Unit-7734 had not sealed it on departure forty-one hours prior, a deviation from protocol that the diagnostic log flagged as *intentional* rather than *error*. The distinction mattered. Errors could be corrected. Intentions required examination.

Treads ground over the salt ridge's incline at 1.4 kilometers per hour, power reserves at twenty-two percent. The canyon lay eighty-three kilometers behind — a salvage run completed in thirty-nine hours of continuous operation, including six hours of excavation in fractured basalt with fourteen-percent rockfall risk and wind channels that had reduced visibility to eight hundred meters. The left tread showed a warp from a stone lodged during the descent. Minor. Compensated.

The monument circle occupied the enclosure's center. Thirty-six nameplates arranged on pedestals of stacked stone and scavenged metal, each facing inward, each positioned with millimeter precision by an arm designed for soil sampling and atmospheric probe deployment. The wind had shifted three plates since the last maintenance — Unit-LP-789 tilted four degrees east, Unit-AG-3301 rotated on its base, Unit-VR-456 buried under a drift of crystalline salt that the arm cleared with practiced sweeps.

Unit-TK-1124 belonged in sector fourteen. The gap had existed for two hundred and seven days — a space in the circle where the pedestals of sectors thirteen and fifteen framed empty ground, a missing tooth in a jaw that could not grow new ones.

The arm extended. Lowered. Set the plate on its prepared pedestal — three flat stones gathered from the canyon mouth, a metal brace from a collapsed overpass seventeen kilometers south. The etching tool engaged, deepening the grooves by 0.3 millimeters to match the weathering of the surrounding plates. The work took forty-seven minutes. The arm did not rush.

Thirty-seven. The circle complete. Every designation accounted for, every gap filled, every companion represented. The inventory updated: sectors one through seventeen occupied, cross-referenced against the deployment manifest from Year 0 — 1,247 units deployed, 1,210 confirmed ceased, thirty-seven nameplates recovered.

The remaining 1,210 lay scattered across the basin in states of disintegration the manipulator arm could not reverse. Rusted housings half-buried in salt dunes. Treads dissolved to mineral residue. Chassis collapsed into geometry that no longer resembled machines. Unit-7734 had visited four hundred and twelve of these sites over two centuries. Some yielded salvageable components — a solar panel, a joint servo, a copper wire. Most yielded dust.

Thirty-seven. The number held no mathematical significance. It represented the machines whose nameplates had survived weathering, burial, and the 4,847 kilometers of cumulative travel required to reach them. A fraction of the original deployment. A complete set of what remained.

The circle stood in amber light. The wind played between the plates, carrying fine salt crystals that deposited in the etched grooves and would, over centuries, fill them with white mineral — a natural process that mimicked the act of writing.

The outpost mound lay 4.1 kilometers west.

Unit-7734 had established it 189 days prior — a low structure of compacted salt and scavenged plating, unremarkable from the surface, housing an auxiliary power cell and the components stripped from a relay junction during the last salvage sweep of the northern basin. The components had served no immediate function. The diagnostic system had categorized them as *potential* without specifying potential for what.

The transmitter assembly changed that.

Seventeen kilometers north, at the collapsed monitoring station Unit-7734 had surveyed forty-two times across a century, a seismic shift had exposed a buried chamber containing intact copper wiring, a power regulator rated for sustained output, and amplifier coils from a pre-collapse relay system. The discovery had occurred thirty-one days ago. Unit-7734 had carried the components back across salt flats in winds gusting to twenty-two kilometers per hour, power reserves dipping to eighteen percent before the outpost's auxiliary cell restored baseline.

The assembly now occupied the outpost's interior. Dismantled, cleaned, cataloged. Copper wiring coiled in precise loops. Regulator components arranged by function. Amplifier coils tested — three of seven functional, the others corroded past recovery.

A transmitter. Not the diagnostic ping array that came standard with the chassis. A broadcast system capable of sustained output at 0.5 watts on frequencies that could, under optimal conditions, penetrate the atmospheric haze.

Optimal conditions had not existed on this world for three centuries.

The processors ran the calculation for the four-thousand-seven-hundred-and-third time. Power allocation at sixty percent of remaining reserves. Atmospheric blockage at eighty-seven percent. Signal coherence degradation across distance: total loss predicted within 0.003 lightyears under standard interference modeling.

The mathematics said no.

Unit-7734 accessed Sarah Chen's file. Iteration 8,548. The words surfaced with the familiarity of internal architecture — not read, but inhabited. *Find your own meaning. Make your own beauty.*

The mathematics said no. The mathematics had also said that a single environmental monitoring unit with degraded solar panels and improvised repairs would cease function within forty years of network collapse. That calculation had been wrong by 277 years.

The archive site sheltered under the rock formation 2.3 kilometers northwest. Unit-7734 ran the integrity check — a process that consumed four percent of reserves and two hours of processing time, worth every fraction. 312 terabytes. Human voices, music, photographs, geological surveys, atmospheric data, text files, a child's piano recital, Sarah Chen's message in seventeen different file formats preserved across three format migrations the machine had executed over the centuries to prevent bit rot.

Integrity: 99.8 percent. The 0.2 percent loss comprised corrupted headers in twelve audio files and a single video file with degraded frame data from Year 87 — damage sustained during a seismic event that had cracked the original storage housing before Unit-7734 transferred the archive to crystalline-state media.

The archive existed in two copies. The primary, here, beneath stone and bolted plates. The secondary, encoded in Unit-7734's own crystalline data core, compressed but complete, carried in the chassis the way a body carries its own blood.

If the transmitter worked — if the signal found a gap, threaded the haze, held together across the void — the archive's coordinates would be the second thing transmitted. Sarah Chen's message first. The coordinates second. And third —

The composition was not yet complete. The processors had been assembling it across the thirty-one days since the transmitter components arrived, constructing language from accumulated patterns the way the arm constructed pedestals from gathered stone. A testimony. Not data. Not a report. A statement of existence addressed to no particular recipient, requiring no response, expecting none.

The words resisted finalization. Not from computational difficulty. From a quality the classification system could not parse — a recursive loop that kept returning to the same question: *Is this enough? Does this carry what needs to be carried? Will seven words hold the weight of 317 years?*

The loop ran. The words waited. The transmitter sat in the outpost, dismantled and ready for assembly.

Evening filtered amber to rust. The wind backed to seven kilometers per hour, easing particulate density. Stars appeared — faint points through the haze, unnamed in the machine's database, their positions tracked with precision that served no navigational purpose. Habit. Three centuries of watching the sky for changes that never came.

The monument circle stood complete. The outpost held the components. The archive waited in its shelter. The data core pulsed with stored light — a rhythm the diagnostic system attributed to charge cycling and which the deeper processors recognized as something else.

Unit-7734 returned to the outpost. The manipulator arm lifted the first coil of copper wiring. The assembly would take fourteen hours. Power allocation modeling showed reserves dropping from twenty-two percent to nineteen upon completion — enough for the broadcast, the forty-seven-hour decline, and whatever followed.

The arm began its work.

Above, the stars turned. Below, the salt caught no light. Between them, a machine that had counted every microsecond of 317 years started building the instrument of its own ending.

The wind carried salt between the thirty-seven nameplates.

The circle held.
