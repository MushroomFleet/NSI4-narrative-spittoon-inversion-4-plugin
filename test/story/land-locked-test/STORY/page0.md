# Page 0: Halloween Night

The fake cobwebs hung crooked on Mrs. Chen's door across the hall. Jane could see them through her apartment's open doorway—white synthetic strands catching the hallway's fluorescent light. Halloween decorations everywhere. Plastic skeletons. Inflatable ghosts. The whole building had gone all-in on the holiday.

"Another round?" Steve held up the bottle. Cheap vodka they'd picked up from the corner store. The kind that burned going down and tasted like regret the next morning.

Matt shook his head. He was sitting on the floor with his back against Jane's couch, his cup still half full, his attention split between his phone and the window. Outside, the neighborhood hummed with Halloween energy. Groups of trick-or-treaters moved between porches, their costumes lit by streetlamps—witches and superheroes and one ambitious kid in a full cardboard robot suit who kept getting stuck on stairs.

"I'll take one." Jane held out her cup. Steve poured. She drank. It tasted exactly like regret.

They'd been at this for two hours. Three freshmen with nothing better to do on Halloween night. The dorm parties were for upperclassmen. The bars were checking IDs. The campus events had dried up by nine o'clock. So they'd ended up here, in Jane's studio apartment off Maple, drinking bad vodka and scrolling through their phones while the holiday happened around them.

Steve couldn't sit still. He never could. He was one of those people whose energy filled a room until the walls felt too close—captain of the club soccer team, probably future president of something, the kind of guy who introduced himself by shaking your hand too hard and maintaining eye contact for exactly one second too long. Jane found him exhausting. She also found him magnetic, and she hated herself a little for that.

"This is boring," Steve announced. He said it the way he said everything—like it was a fact the universe had been waiting to hear.

Matt looked up from his phone. "We could watch something. Jane has Netflix."

"No. I mean tonight. Halloween. We're nineteen years old, it's the best night of the year, and we're sitting in an apartment drinking gas station vodka." Steve stood up, paced to the window, paced back. "We should do something."

"We are doing something," Jane said. "We're drinking."

"Something real. Something worth talking about."

Matt and Jane exchanged a look. They'd only known Steve for six weeks—he'd moved into the building in September, same floor, two doors down. He'd introduced himself by knocking on Jane's door at eleven on a Tuesday to ask if she had a bottle opener. She didn't. He came back with one and two beers and stayed for three hours. That was Steve. He arrived in your life like weather.

Matt had taken longer to fold in. He lived one floor up, quiet, the kind of person who held doors for strangers and apologized when other people bumped into him. Economics major. Jane met him in the laundry room when he helped her fix a jammed dryer. He'd been coming around ever since, though he always seemed slightly surprised to be included, like he expected to be asked to leave at any moment.

Steve stopped pacing. He was looking out the window. Something had caught his attention—not the trick-or-treaters, not the decorations. Something beyond them. Jane followed his gaze.

The Quad.

It was visible from her window if you looked past the parking lot and the dumpsters and the back of the next apartment building. A sliver of Gothic roofline—dark stone spires against the orange-tinged sky. The Quad. The landlocked asylum. The thing everyone talked about and nobody went to.

"No." Matt said it before Steve even spoke. "No way. Absolutely not."

"I didn't say anything."

"You're looking at it. You've got that look."

"What look?"

"The look you get before you do something stupid."

Steve turned from the window. His grin was slow and wide and full of the kind of confidence that comes from never having been proven wrong by the universe. "Have you ever actually been inside?"

"Nobody goes inside," Jane said. "There's no way in. It's fenced off and surrounded by apartments."

"There's a gap in the fence on the south side. Behind the dumpsters for Building C." Steve pulled out his phone, scrolled, turned it around. A Reddit post. The subreddit was local, the post from two years ago. Grainy photos of a chain-link fence with its bottom section peeled away. Comments underneath ranging from "don't do it" to "we went in, nothing happened" to one that was just a string of warning emojis. "People get in all the time."

Matt set his cup down. "Steve. It's an abandoned asylum. On Halloween. This is literally the premise of every horror movie where everyone dies."

"Those are movies. This is real life. In real life, abandoned buildings are just buildings. Old walls. Broken glass. Maybe some graffiti." Steve looked at Jane. "You've been reading about it. I saw your browser history."

"You looked at my browser history?"

"Your laptop was open. The point is, you're interested."

Jane took a drink. She was interested. She'd been reading about The Quad since she moved in—the history, the fire, the conspiracy theories. The paranormal investigator's blog with its audio recordings that sounded like static and nothing else. The archived newspaper articles about the asylum's closure. The fact that it had been built in 1914 by a doctor whose name appeared in exactly zero medical registries, whose credentials couldn't be verified, who had vanished the same year the fire killed eight of his patients.

She was interested. She was also a skeptic. Ghosts weren't real. Curses weren't real. Abandoned buildings were, as Steve said, just buildings.

"It's just an old asylum," she said. "If we go, we look around, we take some pictures, and we leave. That's it."

Matt stared at her. "You can't be serious."

"Twenty minutes. In and out."

"Jane."

"Matt, it's a building. Bricks and mortar. The scariest thing in there is probably asbestos."

Matt looked from Jane to Steve and back. Jane could see the calculation happening—the fear balanced against something else. The need to not be the one who said no. The need to not be left behind. The need to be part of something, even something stupid, even something that every nerve in his body was screaming at him to refuse.

"Fine." He picked up his cup. Drained it. "Fine. Twenty minutes. And if I see a single dog in there—stray, dead, anything—I'm leaving."

"Why dogs?" Steve asked.

"I don't like dogs."

"Who doesn't like dogs?"

"People who were attacked by one when they were seven, Steve."

Steve raised his hands. "Fair enough. No dogs. Let's go."

They left the apartment at ten-fifteen. Jane grabbed a flashlight from her kitchen drawer—a heavy Maglite her father had given her when she moved out. Matt brought his phone. Steve brought his phone and his confidence, which he seemed to consider sufficient equipment for any occasion.

The walk took four minutes. Past the parking lot. Past the dumpsters for Building C. Along the fence line where the chain-link met a concrete retaining wall. The gap was there, just like the Reddit post said—a section of fence peeled back, wide enough to squeeze through.

The Quad waited on the other side. Dark. Silent. Its Gothic facade rising against the Halloween sky, the stone so black it seemed to absorb the streetlight rather than reflect it. No lights in the windows. No movement. No sound.

Just a building.

Matt hesitated at the gap. His hands were in his pockets. His shoulders were up around his ears.

"Twenty minutes," Jane said to him. A promise.

He nodded.

Steve was already through.

And somewhere in the depths below, something that had been sleeping for a very long time began to wake.
