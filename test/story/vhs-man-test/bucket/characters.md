<Alex "Ash" Harlan>
Background: - **Description**: Mid-40s grizzled everyman with a weathered face, stubbled jaw, and receding hairline, dressed in a rumpled janitor's uniform stained from years of mopping up spills in the video store. Stocky build from manual labor, with calloused hands and a perpetual squint from fluorescent lights. Background: Lifelong blue-collar worker, bounced between dead-end jobs since the 90s, now clinging to nostalgia as the last janitor at a dying rental store.
- **Role**: Protagonist and comic anti-hero; the story's central survivor navigating the Backrooms chaos, driving the plot through his impulsive curiosity and resourceful escapes.
- **Personality**: Wisecracking, battle-hardened bravado masking deep-seated jadedness and resignation; optimistic in quips but cynical about the digital world's erasure of his analog youth. Motivated by survival and a stubborn attachment to the past.
- **Quirks**: Constantly mutters one-liners under his breath; fiddles with scavenged junk like VHS tapes as stress toys; exaggerated swagger when cornered, hiding flashes of weary recognition from repeated ordeals.
- **Goals**: Initially, just finish his last shift and collect his final paycheck; escalates to escaping the Backrooms and evading manifestations, ultimately seeking closure on his looping analog nightmares to break free from obsolescence.
- **Relationships**: Lone wolf dynamic—minimal ties to others; vague nostalgia for past co-workers (implied missing from prior noclips); adversarial-yet-dependent on VHS-MAN, viewing it as a quirky "guide" in his chases; indifferent to oblivious real-world strangers like McDonald's patrons, who highlight his isolation.

<VHS-MAN>
Background: - **Description**: Spectral humanoid entity composed entirely of tangled, unraveling VHS tape, standing about 6 feet tall in a bipedal form with spindly, tape-wound limbs. No facial features except glowing blue 80s LED-style eyes embedded deep within its coiled body, emitting a faint tracking-line flicker. Appears glitchy and distorted, like a corrupted tape playback, with a musty scent of old plastic. Background: Emergent from discarded 80s horror media, the sole traverser of realms in the Backrooms limbo.
- **Role**: Enigmatic observer and inadvertent guide; serves as the story's core twist—antagonist-turned-ally, whose movements propel Ash's pursuit and escape, embodying the benevolent chaos of analog persistence.
- **Personality**: Chaotic benevolent; detached amusement at intruders' struggles, without malice—watches like a curious spectator at a bad B-movie. Motivated by inherent "playfulness" of forgotten tapes, delighting in resourceful chaos rather than harm.
- **Quirks**: Moves silently through doors with a subtle tape-whir; "pauses" mid-action like a jammed VCR, observing without interference; leaves faint static trails or glowing eye-flickers as cryptic hints, never speaking but communicating through presence.
- **Goals**: No explicit drive beyond traversing realms and enjoying the spectacle of survival; indirectly aids escape by leading through doors, preserving the loop of analog hauntings for eternal "entertainment."
- **Relationships**: Detached from all; observes Ash with ironic curiosity, treating him as a recurring "star" in its endless show; neutral to other manifestations, lurking superior as the only free agent; no real-world ties, vanishing seamlessly into mundane spaces.
