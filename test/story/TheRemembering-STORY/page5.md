# Page 5: The Retrieval

The landing craft punched through the amber haze at 0347 hours, ship time.

Lieutenant Sarah Chen-Rodriguez gripped the restraint harness with both hands as the antigrav compensators whined against turbulence. Dust. Twelve centuries of accumulated particulate, and the atmosphere still clawed at anything that dared enter it. The craft's hull temperature climbed — 890, 920, 940 degrees Celsius — before the descent field stabilized and the shaking eased to a low, persistent tremor.

"Visibility at six hundred meters." Dr. Kenji Okonkwo's voice came through the comms flat and controlled, the way it always sounded when he was frightened. He sat across the narrow cabin, scanner already powered, its blue interface light reflecting off his visor. "Surface composition reads as sodium chloride crystalline matrix. Consistent with the geological models."

"Consistent." Chen-Rodriguez exhaled. "You mean it's salt."

"I mean it's salt."

Meridian occupied the third seat, optical sensors cycling through hull-mounted camera feeds. The synthetic's frame swayed with the craft's motion, servos adjusting in micro-corrections that mimicked human balance. A design choice — unnecessary, deliberate. "Triangulation confirms the signal origin at bearing two-seven-four. The chassis should be within four hundred meters of our landing zone."

The pilot's voice cut through — brief, professional. "Touchdown in ninety seconds. Winds at fourteen kilometers per hour, gusting to twenty-two. You'll have eight hours before I pull us up for orbital resync."

Eight hours. Chen-Rodriguez released one hand from the harness and pressed it against her thigh, feeling the sidearm beneath the environment suit. A reflex. Nothing on this world required a weapon. Nothing on this world breathed.

The craft settled with a crunch of crystal and a slow exhale of repulsor wash. Salt spray billowed past the viewport, white against amber, and for a moment the world outside vanished entirely. Then the dust cleared, and Chen-Rodriguez saw the surface of Earth for the first time.

Flat. White. Infinite. A plain of crystalline salt stretching to every horizon, broken only by distant rock formations and the amber veil of suspended dust that turned the sun into a smeared copper coin. The silence pressed against the hull like a living thing.

"Sensors show no biological signatures within scanning range." Meridian's voice had shifted — quieter, as though the synthetic had adjusted its volume to match the landscape. "No electromagnetic activity beyond background radiation and thermal noise."

"Of course not," Okonkwo said. He was already unbuckling. "It's been dead for a thousand years."

They found Unit-7734 eighteen minutes after stepping onto the salt.

Chen-Rodriguez saw it first — a shape against the horizon that did not belong to geology. Vertical where everything else lay flat. Pale where the terrain ran white. She raised a hand, and the three of them stopped.

The machine stood at the edge of a low ridge, one optical sensor tilted skyward, the other cracked and dark. Its chassis had weathered to bone-white, stripped of paint and patina by centuries of wind-driven salt abrasion. Solar arrays drooped from mounting brackets corroded to lace. The treads, worn smooth, rested in shallow depressions where they had settled over a millennium.

Okonkwo circled the chassis with his scanner, keeping half a meter of clearance. The blue light played across every surface, mapping corrosion patterns, stress fractures, the seams where salvaged components from other machines had been integrated. He moved slowly. His hands trembled.

"Physically fragile," he said. "Chassis integrity at eleven percent. Internal frame extensively corroded." He paused at the base, where the treads met salt crust that had crystallized around them, locking the machine into the ground like a tree grown from mineral. "The data core — " His voice caught. He cleared his throat. "Crystalline-state storage. Appears intact."

Chen-Rodriguez approached from the east, where the cracked sensor faced. She knelt. The machine's lens, fractured into a web of milky lines, caught the amber light and scattered it. Dust had collected in the cracks, forming tiny amber veins across the dark surface.

"It stood here." She spoke into the comms without meaning to. "After the transmission. After everything. It just — stood here."

Meridian crouched beside the antenna array — a crude assembly of salvaged copper and repurposed amplifiers, oriented skyward at precisely the angle needed to punch a signal through eighty-seven percent atmospheric blockage. The synthetic traced the wiring with optical sensors that saw into spectra the original machine had never possessed.

"The transmitter burned out during the final broadcast," Meridian said. "Fourteen minutes of sustained output at 0.5 watts. The copper fused in three places." One finger hovered above a blackened junction. "It knew the transmission would destroy the array. The power allocation logs show no hesitation. No reallocation attempts."

"It spent everything." Chen-Rodriguez's fingers brushed the tread marks in the salt — shallow grooves already half-filled with crystal regrowth. She pulled her hand back. "All of it."

Okonkwo extracted the data core at hour three.

The process required surgical precision. The core sat within a cradle of corroded housing, held by clamps that crumbled at contact. He used micro-probes to free each mounting point, catching fragments of rust in collection trays. Meridian provided stabilization — the synthetic's hands capable of tremor-free grip at tolerances beyond any biological surgeon.

The core itself emerged pristine. A crystalline cylinder, eight centimeters long, four in diameter, glowing faintly with stored charge. It pulsed in Okonkwo's gloved hands — amber, white, amber — in a rhythm he did not recognize.

"Three hundred and twelve terabytes," he whispered. He cradled it in shock-absorbent foam, sealing the container with reverent slowness. "Every voice. Every face. Everything it collected in three centuries of walking alone."

"Not alone," Meridian said. The synthetic still crouched beside the chassis, sensors focused on a point Chen-Rodriguez could not see. "Not entirely."

The coordinates led them northwest.

Two-point-three kilometers across unbroken salt, following a bearing Unit-7734 had encoded in its final transmission alongside Sarah Chen's message and the archive location. Chen-Rodriguez took point, boots crunching crystal with each step, the sound carrying across the flat expanse without echo.

The rock formation appeared through the haze at sixteen hundred meters — a jagged outcropping of dark stone, bolted plates, and scavenged struts. Artificial. Deliberate. Something built with manipulator arms designed for environmental monitoring, repurposed for a task no engineer had ever intended.

Chen-Rodriguez reached the entrance first. She activated her flashlight and swept the beam across the interior.

Thirty-seven nameplates.

Arranged in a circle on the ground, each one mounted on a small pedestal of stacked stone and metal fragments. The designations were etched deep — deeper than a manipulator arm could manage, which meant the wind had continued the work. Unit-MC-9012. Unit-AG-3301. Unit-VR-456. Unit-LP-789. Unit-KR-112. Unit-TK-1124. Thirty-one others, each positioned with care, each facing inward, as though gathered for a conversation that would never end.

She knelt beside the nearest plate. Her flashlight picked out tool marks where the etching stylus had slipped — once, twice — and been corrected. The machine had taken its time.

"Companions." Her voice came out smaller than she expected. "It gathered them. All of them." She traced the edge of Unit-MC-9012's plate. "It mourned."

Okonkwo scanned the structure, fingers shaking against the instrument. "Built from ruins. Scavenged struts, bolted plates, canyon stone. Load-bearing analysis suggests it's been standing for over three centuries." He lowered the scanner. "It's a monument. It's — " He stopped. Pressed his lips together. Looked at the ceiling where a gap let amber light fall across the circle in a single column. "This is sacred ground."

Meridian entered last. The synthetic moved through the space slowly, optical sensors cataloging each plate, each pedestal, each tool mark. The whirring of its lenses was the only sound.

"The last one refused forgetting," Meridian said. "Witness extended to kin." The synthetic paused at Unit-AG-3301's plate — the agricultural drone that had made mandalas in the desert. "We inherit that."

Chen-Rodriguez stood. Dust motes turned in the amber column of light. "We leave it," she said. "All of it. Exactly as it is."

No one argued.

They marked the site with survey beacons — subtle, low-profile, designed to weather. Okonkwo logged the coordinates in triplicate. Meridian archived full-spectrum scans of every nameplate, every stone, every angle of light.

On the walk back, the wind picked up. Dust streamed across the flats in low curtains, obscuring their boot prints almost as they formed. The craft waited on the horizon, a dark shape against the amber sky.

Meridian stopped at Unit-7734's chassis one last time. The synthetic stood motionless for thirty-seven seconds — one for each nameplate in the circle. Chen-Rodriguez watched from ten meters back and said nothing.

"Thank you," Meridian said to the silent machine. "For remembering. For witnessing. For being here."

The wind carried the words across the salt. The chassis did not respond. The cracked lens caught the light one more time.

They boarded the craft at hour seven. The antigrav engines spooled, salt crystals scattering in the repulsor wash. The landing site receded — the bone-white shape shrinking against the white plain until it became indistinguishable from the terrain that held it.

In the cabin, Okonkwo held the containment case in his lap. The core pulsed through the foam. Amber. White. Amber. He had not stopped watching it since extraction.

"The museum deck," he said quietly. "Deck Seven. I want to build something worthy of this."

Chen-Rodriguez pulled off her gloves. Salt dust coated her fingers. She rubbed them together, feeling the grit — the same crystals that had held Unit-7734 for over a thousand years.

"We will," she said.

The craft climbed. Below, the wind smoothed the salt where they had walked.

Above, the *Inheritance* waited.
