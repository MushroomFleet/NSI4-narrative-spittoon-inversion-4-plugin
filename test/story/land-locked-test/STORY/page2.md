# Page 2: The Cat Came Back

The cellar smelled sweet.

Not candy-sweet, not flower-sweet. The kind of sweet that sat at the back of your throat and wouldn't leave. Like overripe fruit decomposing in summer heat. Like meat left in a cooler without power. The three of them stood at the bottom of the stairs, flashlights cutting pale beams through air thick with dust motes, and that smell wrapped around them like a living thing.

"This is awesome." Steve's grin hadn't faltered since they'd entered The Quad. If anything, it had gotten wider. He swept his phone's light across the cellar—stone walls slick with moisture, a floor of packed earth, wooden support beams darkened with age and mold. "Dude, this is legitimately creepy. This is the best Halloween we've ever had."

"We've been friends for six weeks, Steve." Matt stood on the bottom step, one foot still on the stair above, ready to retreat. "This is our only Halloween."

"Then it's the best one. Come on."

The cellar was larger than it should have been. Jane noticed that immediately. The building's footprint above was maybe sixty feet by eighty—big for a house, reasonable for an asylum. The cellar extended further. Much further. Her flashlight beam disappeared into darkness in every direction, finding no far wall. Just columns of stone. Just shadows.

"Hey." She touched Steve's arm. He barely registered it. "Hey, does this seem... big to you?"

"It's a cellar."

"It's too big. The building above us isn't this wide."

Steve shrugged. "Old buildings have weird foundations. My uncle has a place in Vermont with a cellar that goes under the neighbor's yard. Nobody cares."

He walked deeper. Of course he did. Jane glanced at Matt, who was hugging himself on the stairs, his face a portrait of someone who wanted very badly to be somewhere else.

"We should follow him," she said.

"We really, really shouldn't."

"Matt."

He came down the stairs. One reluctant step at a time.

The cellar opened up as they moved through it. Rooms branched off the central space—some empty, some containing rusted medical equipment that Jane didn't want to identify. Gurneys with restraint bolts. Drainage channels cut into stone floors. A chair with straps at the wrists, ankles, and forehead, its leather cracked and black with something that might have been blood a century ago.

Steve photographed everything.

Matt's breathing had become audible. Fast, shallow, his footsteps lagging behind. Jane found herself in the middle—Steve ranging ahead, Matt drifting back, her the axis between curiosity and terror.

The hum started when they reached the door.

It was set into the far wall of a room that shouldn't have existed—too deep, too far from the stairs, the geometry wrong in ways that Jane's mind kept trying to correct and failing. The door was metal. Heavy. Industrial. And clean. Spotlessly clean, the steel bright and unrusted in a building where everything else was corroded and crumbling. No handle. No lock. Just a flat surface, and behind it, that hum. Low frequency. The kind of sound you felt in your chest, in your teeth, in the fluid of your eyeballs.

"Do you hear that?" Matt whispered.

Steve put his palm flat against the door. "It's vibrating. Feel this."

"I'm not touching that."

Jane stepped closer. The hum intensified. Not louder—deeper. It dropped below the range of hearing and became a pressure, a weight on her sternum, a buzzing in her sinuses. The air in front of the door shimmered. Not heat-shimmer. Something else. A distortion, like reality had been printed on fabric and someone was pulling the threads.

Light leaked from the door's edges. Wrong light. Not white, not yellow. A color Jane couldn't name, couldn't categorize, couldn't look at directly without her vision smearing. It was the color of a migraine aura. The color of the spots you see after staring at the sun. The color of a thing that shouldn't exist.

"We need to leave," Jane said. Her voice came out smaller than she intended. "Right now."

"Are you kidding?" Steve pressed closer to the door. "This is insane. This is—Jane, we found something. Like, actually found something."

"Steve, I'm serious. Something is wrong."

"Something is finally right." He looked back at her, and his eyes were bright with the wrong light, reflecting that impossible color. "Everyone said this place was haunted. Everyone said don't go in. And now we're here and there's actually something—"

The door opened.

Not swung open. Not slid open. The metal simply wasn't there anymore, and what was behind it poured into the room like water through a broken dam. Light and sound and that smell, amplified a thousandfold—sweet and rotten and copper and ozone. The hellmouth.

Jane saw it for a fraction of a second. A wound in the floor. A hole that went down forever, its edges ragged and organic, pulsing with that color, breathing with that hum. Around its rim, the packed earth had crystallized into something glass-like, and in that glass she saw reflections that didn't match the room. She saw herself as a child. She saw her bedroom in Ohio. She saw the dead cat on the porch—Mrs. Henderson's tabby, hit by a car, laid out on the welcome mat like an offering. Eight years old and she'd found it before school, its belly torn open, its eyes filmed over, one paw reaching toward the door as if asking to be let in.

She hadn't thought about that cat in years. Hadn't wanted to.

The hellmouth knew.

It came from the wound in the floor. Not climbing—materializing. The darkness around the portal thickened, condensed, took form. A shape. Low. Four-legged. A cat, but wrong. Wrong the way the building was wrong. Enlarged, stretched, the tabby pattern still visible on matted fur but the body beneath was all wrong angles and too many joints. Its jaw hung open, dislocated, teeth showing—not cat teeth, but long, needle-thin, translucent. Its eyes were Mrs. Henderson's cat's eyes. Filmed. Dead. But seeing.

Steve stepped toward it.

"Steve, don't—"

"Easy." His voice was calm. Confident. The voice of a boy who had never been afraid of anything in his life. "Easy, it's just—"

The cat-thing moved.

Not a lunge. Not a pounce. It folded through space, covering the ten feet between the portal and Steve without appearing to cross the distance. One instant it was at the edge of the hellmouth. The next it was on him. Its jaw unhinged wider than its skull should have allowed, and its needle-teeth sank into Steve's shoulder.

He screamed. The sound was enormous in the cellar, bouncing off stone, multiplying. He grabbed the thing, tried to pull it off. His hands passed through its body in places—solid in some spots, incorporeal in others, the flesh real and unreal in flickering sequence.

"Steve!" Jane lunged forward. Matt was screaming behind her. She grabbed the chair with the straps—heavy, old wood—and swung it at the cat-thing. It passed through. The creature was attached to Steve now, its body merging with his, sinking into him.

Steve's scream changed pitch. Higher. Thinner. His body was pulling inward, contracting. His skin folded, his limbs drew together. The cat-thing was consuming him—not eating, absorbing, pulling him into that wrong space, that non-space, collapsing him into a point of nothingness.

Jane saw his face in the last second. The grin was gone. The confidence was gone. What remained was a nineteen-year-old boy who had never been afraid until this exact moment, and now was afraid of everything, all at once, compressed into a single expression of total comprehension. He understood. In the instant before he disappeared, he understood what this place was. What the hellmouth wanted. What fear really meant.

He imploded. The sound was soft—a gentle pop, like a soap bubble. The cat-thing fell to the floor where he'd stood, smaller now, spent, licking its translucent teeth with a tongue that was too long and too flat.

Matt ran.

Jane heard his footsteps on the stairs, fast and panicked, stumbling. She should have followed immediately. She couldn't move. Her eyes were locked on the spot where Steve had been. No blood. No body. Just empty stone floor and the cat-thing grooming itself, and the hellmouth pulsing behind the door that was now a door again—closed, spotless, humming.

Something shifted in the portal's light. Another shape beginning to form. Darker. Lower to the ground. Something with dense muscle and short fur and a jaw built for crushing.

Matt's fear.

Jane ran.

She took the stairs three at a time, her flashlight beam swinging wild, the building groaning around her as corridors began to shift. Behind her, the sweet smell intensified. The hum rose. And from the cellar, the sound of claws on stone.

Two sets of claws.
