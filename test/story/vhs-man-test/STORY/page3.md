# Page 3: Rewind

Ash was chasing a ghost made of tape through an infinite office building, and the worst part was that he'd done this before.

Not this specific corridor—all the corridors looked the same, yellow walls and brown carpet and fluorescents humming their endless, toneless song—and not this specific chase, which involved him limping through a maze of fallen cubicle partitions with a boombox in one hand and a fluorescent tube in the other, the glass hot enough to burn through his sleeve. A different corridor. Different chase. Same feeling. That sickening déjà vu that sat in his stomach like bad takeout, the certainty that his body remembered something his mind had been made to forget.

VHS-MAN flickered at the junction ahead. Left corridor, right corridor. It chose left. It always seemed to choose, though Ash was starting to wonder if "choice" meant anything to a creature made of magnetic strip. Maybe it moved the way tape moved through a machine—along a predetermined path, following grooves cut into reality itself, rewinding and fast-forwarding through spaces that didn't exist on any blueprint.

"Hey! Wait up, you cassette reject!" He jogged after it. His knee complained. His lungs complained louder. The air down here—wherever "here" was relative to the surface, relative to his store, relative to anything with a postal code—tasted like old carpet and ozone and the plastic off-gas of a thousand decomposing VHS tapes. It coated the inside of his mouth. He could feel it on his teeth.

The left corridor opened into a room. Large. The ceiling vanished into darkness above the fluorescent grid, which hung at odd angles, some panels dead, others flickering in patterns that almost resembled something. Words. Letters. Ash didn't look at them long enough to read them. The room was full of cubicles—real cubicles, with desk surfaces and rolling chairs and computer monitors that showed nothing except snow. CRT monitors. Curved glass. Dust an inch thick on every surface.

VHS-MAN stood in the center of the room. Motionless.

This was new.

Every other time—through twelve corridors and six rooms and one deeply unsettling bathroom that had mirrors showing reflections of places he'd never been—the entity had kept moving. Always ahead, always just out of reach, leading him deeper into the maze with the patient inevitability of a current pulling a swimmer out to sea. Now it stood still. Its coiled body didn't shift. Its arm didn't point. The blue eyes pulsed at a steady rhythm—slow, hypnotic, like a heartbeat made of light.

Ash stopped at the room's entrance. Set the boombox down. Flexed his burning hand. The fluorescent tube cast a weak white glow, barely competing with the overhead grid. He held it out like a sword.

"Alright. Talk to me, tapehead. What's the play?"

VHS-MAN tilted its head. That small, mechanical gesture—the tape coils around its neck adjusting, unwinding an inch and rewinding tighter—that it did when it was looking at him. Really looking. Not just registering his presence the way it registered walls and doors. Studying him.

"You've been leading me around this Yellow Brick nightmare for—" He checked his watch. Dead. "—I don't know how long. My phone's a brick, my watch is dead, and I smell like a Goodwill dumpster. If you're taking me somewhere, take me there. If you're just—"

The cassette echoes started.

Soft at first. A whisper from the walls, barely distinguishable from the fluorescent hum. Then louder. Layered. Audio fragments overlapping—a newscast from the nineties, a commercial jingle for a product that didn't exist anymore, someone reading inventory codes in a voice that sounded like his. The sounds built on each other, weaving into a pressure that sat behind his eyes and pushed.

"Not this again." Ash lifted the fluorescent tube higher. The light drove the whispers back two feet, creating a circle of relative silence around him. He'd figured that out in the third corridor—the echoes hated light. Not the Backrooms' own sick yellow glow from the ceiling grid, which they seemed to feed on. Real light. Bright light. The hot white blaze of a fluorescent tube pulled from its housing and wielded like a torch.

The tube wouldn't last. It was already dimming, the filament inside losing its fight against whatever field this place generated. He had maybe twenty minutes before it went dark.

VHS-MAN watched the whispers retreat. Tilted its head the other way. Then it moved—not toward a door this time. Toward a desk. It extended one tape-wound arm and pointed at the surface.

Ash approached cautiously. The desk held the usual detritus—keyboard with missing keys, a coffee mug filled with something that had long since petrified, a stapler, a phone with a coiled cord leading nowhere. And a boombox.

Not his boombox. Another one. Older—late eighties model, fake woodgrain side panels, a cassette deck with the door hanging open. He picked it up. Heavy. The batteries were corroded, white crust leaking from the compartment. Useless as a music player. Perfect as a weapon.

He looked at VHS-MAN. The entity's eyes pulsed faster. If tape monsters could look pleased with themselves, this one was grinning.

"You're arming me." Ash hefted the boombox. Solid. Good weight. The corner edges were sharp where the plastic had chipped. "You sick, beautiful glitch. You're actually arming me."

VHS-MAN turned and walked through the far wall.

Not through a door. Through the wall itself. The plaster rippled around its body like water, the tape coils compressing, and the entity passed through as if the wall were a projection. The surface solidified behind it. Smooth. Unbroken.

"Cool. Great. Totally normal." Ash picked up both boomboxes. One in each hand. The cords trailed behind him like leashes. The fluorescent tube went under his arm, still glowing, his sleeve smoldering where the hot glass pressed.

A door on the far side of the room stood open. Not the wall VHS-MAN had passed through—a different exit. The entity's blue glow was visible through it, already moving down the next corridor.

Ash followed.

The next three corridors came fast. The Backrooms compressed—ceilings dropping, walls narrowing, the carpet giving way to bare concrete. The fluorescents thinned out, leaving pools of darkness between them. Ash moved through the dark zones at a dead sprint and slowed in the light. The cassette echoes stalked the shadows. He could hear them tracking him, that layered whisper-hiss following just behind the edge of his fluorescent tube's reach.

In the third corridor, a Betamax hulk found him.

It came through a side door—a sudden, violent eruption of dark mass and grinding gears. Not the same one from earlier. Smaller. Faster. Its reels spun at a higher pitch, the body more compact, built for speed in these tighter passages. Ash saw it for half a second before it was on him.

He swung the spare boombox. Connected. The impact sent shockwaves up his arm and cracked the hulk's forward reel. It staggered sideways, crashed into the wall, and came back angrier—reels spinning wild, arms windmilling, that grinding roar filling the corridor.

"Hail to the king, baby!" Ash ducked a swing that would have taken his head off, came up inside its reach, and drove the chipped corner of the boombox into the gap between its shoulder and chest. Plastic met plastic. Something inside the hulk popped. Static discharged—a visible arc of blue-white electricity that jumped from the broken reel to the boombox's antenna.

The hulk went rigid. The reels stuttered. Stopped. Started again, slower. The thing was hurt—damaged, at least—its body listing to one side, one arm hanging loose.

Ash didn't wait. He ran. Through the next door. Through a room of collapsed ceiling tiles and exposed ductwork. Through another corridor that branched into three identical passages, and he chose the one with the faintest trace of blue light at its end.

VHS-MAN.

Three doors ahead. The gap was closing. Two doors now. Ash could see the entity's form more clearly—the individual tape strands that comprised its body, some wound tight, some loose and trailing, the whole structure in constant slow motion, rotating and adjusting like a living spool. The eyes were brighter in this deeper part of the maze. Less LED flicker, more genuine luminance. Something powered by whatever weird physics made this place run.

A film-reel tendril dropped from the ceiling.

It missed his face by inches. Ash flinched, stumbled, caught himself on a cubicle wall. Another tendril rose from the carpet to his right. He slashed it with the boombox edge. The film strip severed and whipped back. A third wrapped his flashlight tube. Pulled. The glass cracked in his grip.

The fluorescent tube died.

Darkness rushed in. Not total—the ceiling grid still cast its yellow pall—but the sharp white light that had kept the echoes at bay was gone. The whispers surged. Louder. Closer. He could feel them now, not just hear them—a pressure on his skin, like standing too close to a speaker at full volume.

"Okay." Ash gripped the boomboxes. One in each hand. No light. No torch. Just plastic and adrenaline and a mouth that wouldn't stop running. "Okay, new plan. Same as the old plan. Run."

VHS-MAN's glow beckoned from the next corridor. Two doors ahead. One. The entity was slowing down. Letting him close the distance.

Or something was slowing it down.

The Backrooms shifted. Ash felt it in his inner ear—that subtle tilt, like the floor had changed its angle by one degree. The walls groaned. The ceiling sagged. Doors rearranged themselves in the corners of his vision, frames sliding along the walls like pieces on a puzzle board. The maze was reorganizing.

Tightening.

The corridor ahead of VHS-MAN was shrinking. The entity's coils compressed as the walls pressed in. Its eyes flickered—agitated, the tracking lines running fast. For the first time, it looked uncomfortable. For the first time, the thing that moved through doors like they were suggestions looked like it was being squeezed.

The Backrooms didn't want them to leave.

Ash reached the next door. VHS-MAN was right there—five feet ahead, close enough that he could see the individual magnetic strips that formed its chest, the way they overlapped like scales, the old brand names still visible on some of them. Memorex. Maxell. TDK. The ghosts of home recordings, family videos, rented movies never returned.

"Move," Ash said. "Whatever you are. Whatever this is. Move."

VHS-MAN moved.
